Distinguished delegates,
Dear friends,

It is a great pleasure to share my thoughts at the 8th Indian Ocean Conference on our voyage to new horizons of maritime partnership. Let me express my gratitude and appreciation to the Government of Sultanate of Oman, specifically to my brother FM Badr Albusaidi, to the organizers India Foundation, RSIS and to Ram Madhav ji, who has been the force behind the conference for so many years.

Friends, we meet at a time when there is considerable churn in world affairs. At such a juncture, an open and constructive exchange of views is of particular benefit. I am confident that all of us will find great value in the discussions that we will be holding over the next two days.

Changes in the global order may be expressed through new ideas and concepts. But they are also reflected in the evolving landscape. The Indian Ocean region is no exception to that rule. And this matters not just to us as inhabitants of this community, but given our salience in so many dimensions, to other regions and nations as well. After all, as we heard from previous speakers, the Indian Ocean is veritably a global lifeline. It’s production, consumption, contribution and connectivity is central to the manner in which the world runs today.

At the two ends of the ocean, this churn is at its sharpest today. In the Middle East/West Asia, there is a serious conflict underway with the potential for further escalation and complication. At the same time, longstanding issues are being revisited, sometimes with a radically different approach. Its maritime consequence is visible in a serious disruption of global shipping, with considerable cost to our economies. There are questions which arise from our ability and willingness to respond, as indeed from the partnerships relevant to that task.

At the other end, the Indo-Pacific has been witnessing deeper tensions and sharper contestations. The scenario is intrinsically maritime in nature, involving respect for and observance of international law. There are other concerns, some related and some autonomous. Stronger assertions of interests is one issue; concern about unilateral changes to the status quo another. From India’s own experience, we can say that adhering to agreements and understandings is a central element to ensuring stability and predictability.

The region in between is where most of us come from, being littoral states or island nations of the Indian ocean. Each country has its individual challenge, but nevertheless, there are some general trends worth noting. Many are developmental in character but do, in some form or the other, impinge on maritime behaviour. Like other parts of the Global South, the Indian Ocean nations too face resource constraints and economic headwinds. Many of them are struggling to meet their SDG targets. In quite a few cases, debt is a serious concern. Some of that arises from stresses of the international economy, but in certain cases, from imprudent borrowing and unviable projects.

Another common issue is that of rebuilding connectivity in the region, after decades of colonial – era disruption. To make this a truly shared endeavor, it is vital to ensure that connectivity initiatives are consultative and transparent, not unilateral and opaque. Yet another widespread concern is the challenge faced by Indian Ocean states to monitor their EEZ and secure their fishing interests. Nor can they be impervious to illegal trafficking of various kinds and the specter of terrorism. Each of these dimensions – and certainly their cumulative impact – has a strong maritime implication. Our journey to new horizons must necessarily focus on addressing these challenges.

How is India contributing to those endeavors? Obviously, by rapidly strengthening its own capabilities and forging partnerships with Indian Ocean neighbours, near and far. But also, by shouldering responsibilities, stepping up in times of trouble and providing leadership where required. Let me underline this by providing 10 relevant examples :

One, Stabilising economies and societies under stress would surely rank among the most important. As the impact of COVID and conflict unfolded, India was the source of vaccines, medicines, food, fuel and fertilizer for many others. The biggest commitment it made was to Sri Lanka – a financial package of USD 4 billion to stabilize its economy that had slid into a crisis.

Two, the India – Middle East – Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and the India Myanmar Thailand Trilateral Highway (IMTT) would be among the two key collaborative connectivity initiatives under consideration. The International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is another significant example. India is obviously the common element in all of them. IMEC and INSTC have an explicit maritime segment, while the IMTT would provide a land link between India and the Pacific.

Three, we have increasingly been active in a First Responder mode in the Indian Ocean region. This could be the conflict in Yemen, natural disasters in Mozambique, Sri Lanka or Myanmar, earthquake in Nepal and Turkiye or a water crisis in the Maldives. Both off Mauritius and Sri Lanka, India has responded to significant oil spills.

Four, recognizing that an institutional response is required for disaster situations, India has been active in encouraging plurilateral cooperation. The most notable of these is the Quad initiative that encourages interoperability and cooperation for such contingencies. Similarly, the ReCAAP centre at Singapore to which India contributes helps address the challenge of piracy.

Five, in a world of increasing traditional and non – traditional threats in the maritime domain, it is essential that there is a common operating picture as well as shared platforms. The International Fusion Centre located outside Delhi aims to do just that. By establishing coastal surveillance radars and partnering on White Shipping agreements, maritime traffic is made safer and more secure for our collective benefit.

Six, it is unfortunately not just enough to prepare or even prevent. Extreme situations sometimes require a robust countering, including through the deployment of naval forces. For more than a year now, India has been doing precisely that in the Northern Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden. Today, we are seeing some improvement in maritime safety and security as a result of such coordinated responses.

Seven, training and equipping other navies and coast guards is a natural extension of this approach. India has such collaboration with a range of countries, from Vietnam to Mauritius and Mozambique to Sri Lanka.

Eight, ensuring trusted communication in a digital era is a crucial national security objective for many of us. This is a task too big to be attempted by most individual nations. Participating in consortiums is therefore an inevitable outcome. Both as government and as vendor, India is contributing its fair share and more in this regard. The visit just concluded of PM Modi to the US highlighted this particular dimension.

Nine, in a globalized world, there is a growing realization that distance cannot be a justification for agnosticism on matters key to global welfare. As a result, the Indo – Pacific is experiencing activity of both resident and non – resident powers. Harmonizing them is a challenge that India, in particular, is well placed to address. It has the confidence of the Global South as well as the credentials to engage major powers. We strive to ensure that agendas alien to our ethos and outlook are not inserted in the region. And equally encourage respect for UNCLOS in both spirit and letter.

And finally tenth, India has been energetic in institution - building in the Indian Ocean region. We have the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) whose current Secretary General is a senior Indian diplomat. We have BIMSTEC, whose SG is here today. We look forward to the BIMSTEC Summit soon. There is the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), which is a productive conclave of naval representatives. There is the Colombo Security Conclave and there is the India Indo-Pacific Oceans Intiative. And of course, we have the Indian Ocean Conference itself, which brings together so many stakeholders at various levels.

Ladies and Gentlemen, our voyage to new horizons is best done as a coordinated flotilla of the Indian Ocean. We are understandably a diverse group in terms of history, geography, development, politics or culture. But what unites us is a common devotion to the well-being of the Indian Ocean region. In a volatile and uncertain era, we seek stability and security as the baseline. But beyond that, there are ambitions and aspirations that we strive to achieve. They will be easier reached when we look out for each other, supplement our strengths and coordinate our policies. I can assure you all that India will be in the forefront of these endeavours.

I thank you for your attention.

It is a great pleasure to welcome you again in New Delhi and I’m also very pleased that you brought your distinguished delegation along with your Deputy Foreign Minister.

I know that in the last year, our relationship has seen huge up swing. It is not many relationships where we can say we have had rapid exchange of Prime Ministerial visits as we have had. We have of course a very strong political comfort, a societal connection, a people-to-people understanding. But like any relationship we would like to have more contemporary forms, more trade, more investment, more technological collaboration. Perhaps also look to see whether we can work together on connectivity. We also are very appreciative of the fact that today you are a member of the UNSC. We have been ourselves a member very fairly recently. So you shoulder a lot of international responsibility at a very important time. So that also makes our discussions very valuable.

Once again I welcome you today. I’m very confident that I will have a good discussion here on our bilateral cooperation. But I would be very interested on your regional perspectives and global understandings and on your multilateral insights.

Thank you."

भारत की आदरणीय राष्ट्रपति महोदया, श्रीमती द्रौपदी मुर्मू जी की, गरिमामयी उपस्थिति में, 18वें प्रवासी भारतीय दिवस के, समापन सत्र में, आप सभी का स्वागत करते हुए, मुझे बहुत खुशी हो रही है।

मैं आदरणीय राष्ट्रपति जी का, हृदय से आभार प्रकट करना चाहूँगा कि, उन्होंने अपनी उपस्थिति से, इस कार्यक्रम की शोभा बढ़ाई, और प्रवासी भारतीय सम्मान पुरस्कार प्रदान करने के लिए, अपनी सहमति दी। यह विशेष सौभाग्य की बात भी है, कि वह खुद उड़ीसा की पवित्र धरती से हैं।

Friends,

The Indian diaspora has made outstanding contributions to both India and the world in diverse domains based on their immense talent, creativity, dedication, commitment, and perseverance. From holding political offices and leading organizations to excelling in various domains and walks of life, they have left an indelible mark on global society. Their extraordinary achievements have made India and Indians proud and have strengthened our relationships with other peoples and nations. When the world thinks of India, its particular image or relationship is what is shaping our collective brand.

The Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards that would be conferred by Hon’ble President of India on select members of the Indian diaspora are a recognition of their achievements. At the same time, they are also a statement of the value which India attaches to its diaspora. I felicitate the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awardees and I am confident that they will continue to be an effective bridge to the world.

Friends,

The last few days have allowed us opportunities to explore various facets of diaspora activities, interests and aspirations. Quite appropriately, the overarching theme is about contributing to a Viksit Bharat. We have had panels on youth leadership, migrant skills, sustainable development, Nari Shakti and cultural connections. I am sure that these conversations and networking provided by the PBD platform have motivated all of us.

Today, India is the fifth largest economy, likely to be the third by the end of the decade. Our contributions and responsibilities are growing by the day. So too are our external exposure and commitments. We approach the world with the twin perspectives of India First and Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. When India progresses, so does one-sixth of humanity. When we do global good, our own people stand equally to gain. This is now an era of greater inter-dependence, technology flows and talent mobility. In many ways, it is the diaspora that will help define our image as a resurgent civilization.

Friends,

The PBD serves as a catalytic platform in that regard. It is therefore a matter of great satisfaction that we have had a productive and wide-ranging discussions in the last few days. My gratitude to the Hon’ble President for gracing the occasion as it culminates.

For two decades now, the Ministry of External Affairs has been organizing the PBD Convention across the country. Wherever we have gone, wherever we have met, it has helped to raise the international profile of the state and strengthen its diaspora bonding. I am confident that Odisha too will take full advantage of this opportunity.

Let me conclude by thanking Team MEA and Team ICCR for their untiring efforts to make this PBD a resounding success. My deepest appreciation for the cooperation and partnership extended by the Odisha State Government. But most of all, we thank you – our Pravasi Bhartiya brothers and sisters – for being here today and renewing your bonds with Maa Bharati.

Namaskar Again and Jai Jagannath!"

दोस्तों,

आज 18वें प्रवासी भारतीय दिवस में आप सभी का स्वागत करते हुए अत्यंत ख़ुशी हो रही है। हर दो साल में आयोजित होने वाला यह समारोह, एक पारिवारिक पुनर्मिलन जैसा है। विदेशों में रहने वाले भारतीय, अपने देश में हो रही प्रगति और विकास को स्वयं देख पाते हैं, अनुभव कर पाते हैं। आप सभी , ना केवल अपने जीवन की उपलब्धियों पर गर्व करते हैं, बल्कि विदेशों में हमारे लिए बढ़ते सम्मान को भी अनुभव करते हैं। और साथ ही साथ हम भारतीय भी, विदेशों में रह रहे अपने परिजनों की सफलता और उपलब्धियों पर गर्व करते हैं।

Friends,

In a globalized era, the diaspora only becomes more important with each passing year. Whether it is technology, best practices or resources, be it tourism, trade or investment, the two-way flows you enable are invaluable. As we strive to build a global workplace, this will be even more so in times to come.

The very people-centric changes we promote in India also benefit the diaspora. This could be enhancing ease of doing business, promoting ease of living or facilitating connectivity and travel. The application of digital technologies to ensure diaspora welfare is also apparent. In the last decade, we have seen the simplification of passport issues and renewal as well as of attestations. Consular services, all of you have seen, have improved, welfare measures have increased, grievance platforms are effective and embassies and consulates across the world are more responsive. And most important, in times of difficulties, you can be confident that the Modi Sarkaar has your back.

Friends,

The hosting of this PBD in Odisha is reflective of the Modi Sarkar’s Purvodaya policy. In so many ways, Odisha represents the full richness of our history and culture. Be it Darshan of Mahaprabhu Shri Jagannath ji, or Lingaraj bhagwan, visiting Konark temple, experiencing cultural festivals, folk arts, state products and cuisine, many of you actually had direct experience of this during this visit. But as Foreign Minister, I also want to highlight the external impact of Odisha. The famous Bali Yatra is actually a precursor of what is today the Government of India’s Act East Policy. When we define ourselves as an Indo-Pacific nation, we do so from the Eastern seaboard of Odisha. This gathering should inspire you all to nurture more strongly our heritage, traditions and identity.

Friends,

We are all assembled at a time when the world may look more uncertain and perhaps even more volatile. However, the message that you will take away from this occasion is of a Bharat that is more confident, modernizing and inclusive. Where tradition and technology go hand in hand. When the journey towards Viksit Bharat is ongoing. And each one of you, in your own way, can make a difference to the realization of that goal. I Welcome you all again and I wish you all a productive convention.

Jai Jagannath! Jai Bharat! Jai Hind !"

My Pravasi Brothers and Sisters

Namaskar and Jai Jagannath

In the course of a long work-life, I have been called many things, today for the first time I was called a second engine of a train, it is a novel description but a very good one, I really appreciate it very much and I think the message of double engine is the first message we want to give you from this event. But I do want to ask all of you, our Pravasi visitors especially of the doing a joint business session on a occasion like this, because Persons of India Origin and Non Resident Indian, you are in many ways our connect to the world. We often use the word ‘living bridge’ for all of you and the fact is India will be unique in terms of a major power rising which has actually used, is using and will continue to use its diaspora as a very important pathway of its globalisation and for its rise in the international order.

Now why is that important. It is important because if you look at the history of the world especially modern world no country has grown by itself, every country has grown with global partners and at this time for us, that partnership, a partnership that will supplement resources which will infuse technology, which will introduce best practices that is absolutely essential if India is to attain this potential and that is where NRIs and PIOs can make a difference.

Now, our Prime Minister often talks of 3Ts when it comes to evaluating Foreign Policy, in fact, in our Ministry we use 3Ts to evaluate our own people. 3Ts are Trade, Technology and Tourism and I want you today to reflect on those 3Ts look at it as you are in Bhubaneswar from the prospective of Odisha.

So the first T Trade, I think you have seen through the presentations, what a blessing Odisha has in terms of resources, but resources do not automatically translate into Trade. Resources need investments, resources need facility, resources need connectivity and today how to increase, how to do the value add, so that what you trade is not the just resources but the value add from it and how the leverage the location of Odisha because one looks ahead, the eastern seaboard of India is going to become crucial exposure, connect of India to the world.

We have spoken of the look east policy, in many ways you can say that the look east policy has a historical origin in the state is called Bali Yatra that the connect to the South East Asia actually started in Odisha. Today this eastward connection and I can visualise it in coming decades when I was last time in Singapore with which we have a Ministerial Mechanism, one of the important subjects we discussed Green Shipping Corridors. So whether it is orthodox shipping, whether it is green shipping, whether it is power grids, whether as I say it is resources to value add on it, the potential for trade based from Odisha is enormous.

The second T is of course Technology, but this T is particularly acquiring a connotation in the world today. Technology is not like a manufactured good, it has in the digital era a very high element of trust. Countries, people, organisations want to know where is the data, who is processing it, who is harvesting it, who will deploy it and technology is therefore increasingly associated with trusted talent. So when we speak here and my colleague the Principal Secretary spoke about it we saw little bit of it in the slide as well. The talent of Odisha the fact that today you have young demography, you have a strong education backbone of the state. Today technology also offers a lot of possibilities for collaboration.

And the third is of course Tourism, as many of you perhaps would be here for the first time, many of you come from the state. I can tell you, I had the opportunity yesterday to see some of the tourism possibilities for myself. I think this state is simply incredible in terms of what it has to offer and I again its not just for aesthetic satisfaction I am saying this. Many thinks that it is investment pitch. Tourism is the biggest employer generator and multiplier in the world. Those who will invest in tourism in this state are actually contributing to development and inclusive growth in the state in a very very powerful way.

So I would today other than the message of double engine, want to give you the message of 3Ts that Trade with and from Odisha, Technology and Tourism, there are really important dimension that the state has to offer. I am very glad again the point made about the Modi Government’s commitment of Purvodaya. The renaissance, revival and rejuvenation of the east. India was historically at the greatest point when the eastern parts of India were at the height of glory and I will tell you one of the earliest commitments in this third term of Modi Government was to take the practical decisions to enable the Purvodaya to happen, and a crucial a fulcrum of that in many ways is the state of Odisha.

So let me conclude by saying that, I am fairly long time in the government, a little less in politics, briefly even in business and I can tell you that when people look for investment, when people look for business, at the end of the day what is most important for them is to get good sense about their partners. They will evaluate ease of doing business, they will look at ease of living, you know how non bureaucratic a decision making is, they will look at the quality of infrastructure, what GatiShakti is delivering and will continue to deliver. They will assess the talent of society, they will look for political stability, they will look for policy stability which come from political stability. But at the end of the day, it is not just the information that the investors and business partners will seek, they will also look at the quality of the leadership, today you have Team Odisha’s leadership in front of you. I am confident that it inspires as much confidence in you as it does in me. And I am really confident that today’s meeting is the beginning of conversation that many of you will come to the state again and again that your confidence will translate into business propositions and into investment decisions.

Thank again for your attention."

I am very pleased to welcome you all to the Youth Pravasi Bharatiya Divas 2025 in Bhubaneswar today.

You all know that it is customary to hold a conclave of our younger generation as part of the PBD celebrations. The thinking behind that is one of recognizing the special contribution that young minds make, at home and abroad. And indeed, in connecting them more effectively for mutual good. At a time when so many key developments in the world are being shaped by this younger generation – whether we talk of AI and EV, innovation or startups, space or drones, sports - chess, cricket – there is all the more reason to do so.

Friends,

At home, we have just started our journey towards Viksit Bharat in the Amrit Kaal. This is an endeavour that is very much about the future generation. After all, it is in this period that they will come to the front ranks of our society and lead our nation. A large part of our efforts is to give the right motivation to the younger generation to accelerate their efforts. While development itself is a very complex task, it becomes much easier when we are confident that nothing is beyond us. I still recall some time ago an observation by the famous badminton star, PV Sindhu, on why Prime Minister Modi is a youth icon. She summed it up as his attitude which moved our nation from ‘chalta hai’ to ‘badal sakta hai’ to ‘hoga kaise nahin?’.

Indeed, it is this very spirit which has driven our achievements in very recent years. When confronted by the Covid pandemic, India demonstrated a remarkable resilience and strong recovery thereafter and I remember working with Mansukhbhai, the Health Minister during that period. The very country that was predicted to go under ended up supplying vaccines and medicines to the entire world. A different but equally telling example is what we see in the realm of space, where there is a growing competition internationally. Our Chandrayaan-3 landing, the Aditya L1 observatory and the proposed Gaganyaan mission are powerful inspirations. In a digital era, the scale of UPI transactions speaks volumes both of our infrastructure and of our mindsets. The new India, with 90,000 startups and 100 plus unicorns, has calling cards like Drone Didi, Atal tinkering labs, hackathons, green hydrogen mission or nano-fertilizers.

Friends,

Ambitious visions need strong foundations to be realized. Our collective prospects are no exception to that rule. Here again, it is critical to invest in our youth in order to achieve their full potential. Many of you would be familiar with various campaigns and programmes to develop India, undertaken since 2014 under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Whether it is Swacch Bharat or Beti Padhao, Awas or Anna Yojana, Mudra or Swanidhi, Ayushman Bharat or Jal Jeevan, each one of them has been a transformational effort. However, if you were to see them in their entirety, connecting those dots will give you an appreciation of how we are securing the future of our youth. They will help bring their skills and creativity to the fore, ensuring that India’s talents are fully available to the global workplace.

Friends,

Given the rapidity of changes underway, it is also essential that we step up efforts to keep the diaspora continuously connected. It is a matter of satisfaction to know that Know India Programme and Bharat Ko Janiye Quiz are now getting much more traction than previous years. We also regularly welcome the visits of PIO journalists to India. Let me take the opportunity to urge you on behalf of Prime Minister Modi to promote India as a tourism destination. If young Indian PIOs bring their equally young friends from abroad to explore our uniquely rich and diverse heritage and culture, this will surely become a lifelong habit.

Let me say a few words for our guest of honor, normally we pick somebody from the political world for that position. On this occasion we made a departure, I think, a very understandable and a very justifiable departure of picking someone from the world of media, from the world of business because young Indians today are succeeding in so many domains and it is important that we recognize that.

Friends, allow me also to say a few words about the great state of Odisha,

This State offers a tremendous opportunity to experience personally much of what we would be discussing in the course of the PBD. Its cultural festivals and religious and archaeological sites are a reminder why we in India consider ourselves to be a civilizational society. It is equally a living testament to the developmental progress in all its dimensions. And when it comes to the youth, their optimism and energy is very much on display in Odisha, whether it is in institutions of learning or those we encounter in daily life.

So let me conclude by saying this,

We are today well on the way to address longstanding challenges to build modern, inclusive and progressive society. Our quest is unique because the largest nation in the world is developing in that manner in a democratic framework. The mantra of that journey is to advance, as Prime Minister Modi says, advance on the two legs of technology and tradition. And the youth can surely be the defining factor in the pace of that endeavour and the realization of our goals.

So once again I welcome you to Bhubaneshwar, I welcome you to PBD 2025. I am sure all of you will have a remarkable next few days ahead.

I thank you for your attention.

Jai Jagannath, Jai Bharat, Jai Hind"

Government of India","December 15, 2024","Dr. Raja Mohan,

Mr. Happymon Jacob,

Dear friends,

I'm really very pleased to join you today as we release a new platform, in a way, not just a magazine. And I'm glad because, in a way, I see this as an additional forum for debate and argumentation in our country. And I think we need more forums.

Now, when one looks at the public space, I think the question really is what is the utility of such exercises? What is the impact of such exercises? And I want to start with a moment of honesty. And that honesty is that if you look back at the last 25 years, and I grant you I have a vested interest in this statement, but if you look back the last 25 years, in this country, Track 1 has been consistently ahead of Track 2 when it comes to diplomacy, foreign policy, and keeping up with the world. In fact, if you look at many of the big ideas, much of the advocacy of change, I would say really it's interesting that Track 1 has outpaced Track 2. Which is why today I'm happy with this endeavour, because I do think that this dynamic of Track 1-Track 2, government-think tank, official-academic needs changes in our country. That our public space discourse should not be theological, it should not be polemical. It should not come as a defence of the past versus, a compulsion to move beyond the past. So I hope very much, and certainly I have an advantage over the rest of you, I've had a chance to read the magazine. So for me, a platform that signifies realism, which is contemporary, which is ambitious, I think it makes such a platform relevant, and it is in that expectation today that I join Dr. Raja Mohan and his team.

Now, if one reflects on foreign policy, you know, there are four big factors which should cause us to actually ask ourselves what are the changes which are necessary in foreign policy.

One, and I happened, by coincidence to speak about it yesterday. For many, many years, we had what someone else very pithily summed up as the Nehru Development Model. That was a book which was yesterday released by Dr. Arvind Panagariya. Now, the Nehru Foreign Development Model produced a Nehru Foreign Policy. I mean, it was obvious. And it wasn't just what was happening in our country. There was an international landscape in the 40s and 50s and 60s and 70s, which was bipolar. Then there was a unipolar landscape. And both those landscapes have also changed. On top of it, we have seen, particularly the last 25 years, a very intense globalization, a strong interdependence between countries.

So, in a way, the relationship and the behaviour of states towards each other has also changed. And finally, if one looks at the impact of technology, technology on foreign policy, technology on state capability, technology actually on our daily existence, that too has changed. So, if the domestic model has changed, if the landscape has changed, if the behavioural pattern of states have changed, and if the tools of foreign policy have changed, how can foreign policy remain the same? So, my point to you today is, when we speak about changing foreign policy, if there is talk of a post-Nehruvian construct, it should not be treated as a political attack. I mean, it didn't require Narendra Modi to do it. Narasimha Rao started it. So, I think we need to be grounded. We need to be realistic. We need to be practical in this country. And the foreign policy discourse within Track 2 and between Track 2 and Track 1 would certainly improve if we move in that direction.

Now, of course, when you say, ok, things are going to change, that then begs a different question. So, do we defend? Do we manage? Do we advance? Do we do all of the same? And then there is another question, which is one which Raj raised, which today, if our GDP is what it is, if our external exposure is what it is, how ambitious should we be? What is it we are really aiming for? And what should be the timing of what we do? You know, when do we raise our heads to what degree on what issue? I think that's also a very important concern. So, my point to you is, just like the economic debates and the economic model of this country became more open, I think foreign policy debates, foreign policy thinking of this country also has to keep pace with what is happening in the country and needs to be more open.

And for that, it's important to have an integrated outlook, which is why I was very pleased that this opening issue of this magazine starts with some thoughts about grand strategy that are offered by Dr. Rajamohan. So let's talk a little bit about grand strategy. If today our aspiration at home is to become a Viksit Bharat, surely there must be a foreign policy for Viksit Bharat. And that foreign policy, in a way, I would say, we had about a decade ago, suggested the need for India to start thinking of moving towards a leading power. How to be more ambitious? How to plan ahead? Now, some of it is also about positioning. A country will move ahead if it has, in a sense, the most friends, the least problems, the best relationships, the minimal baggage. And in that positioning, I think this concept of Vishwa Bandhu came about, which is a country which, in a way, is friends to all, or nearly all, you can say, friends to the maximum. And if you have friends to a maximum, obviously your positioning is optimal, your problems, common sense would tell you, are minimal. And in that kind of situation, I think we have to also take into account the landscape. Because the global landscape, for a variety of reasons, and I'll talk about it a little bit, has also become very volatile, it's become very turbulent, it's very uncertain. So, here you have a picture of an India which is growing. Raj put some numbers on it, which will have a foreign policy which will reflect that growth, which will respond to all the changes that we are talking about in the world, between countries, within countries, which will look at issues like technology, which will look at how the global order itself is changing. So, the task which is cut out for us, because Viksit Bharat means India's rise. So, how does India rise amidst uncertainty? And this is a big task. Because generally rising powers like predictability, like stability, they value it more than anything else. But if the reality of the world is going to be something very different, we cannot not rise. We have to continue to rise. We just have to plan it for a very difficult circumstance in which the world is going to be.

So, how do you do that? As I said, by some mixture of offense, of defense, of hedging, of prudence, of joining in rebalancing, of participating in globalization, or to be more accurate, re-globalization, hopefully on different terms, of taking advantage of interdependence, which is also a point made, I think, in different articles in that magazine, of accelerating multipolarity and of utilizing for our benefit fully the impact of technology. Now, in the grand strategy essay, which Dr. Rajamohan has begun this volume with, he has, in a sense, spelt out four elements. One, the importance of working with the West. Two, the need for strategic autonomy. Three, the requirement to expand multipolarity. And fourth, the importance of the non-Western world, including the Global South. I agree, but I think perhaps a few more elements, or in a sense, a certain set of concepts need to give that flesh and practicality on the ground.

And I were to present to you a conceptual sense of Indian foreign policy today, I would first invite you to look at the world in concentric circles. So you have a neighborhood, first, you can say, a SAGAR in the oceans, the Act East and Indo-Pacific to the East, the Gulf and the whole Link West and the IMEC to the West, leading all the way up to Eurasia and to Europe. The second is, of course, the world stage. A world stage where, increasingly, we are a player of consequence, a player to whom others turn to, even if we are bashful at times, and where, therefore, to get the best out of that, we need to have a multi-vector foreign policy. We need to look at an identity of interest with other middle and upper middle powers. We need to focus and play regional contradictions to our benefit, obviously. And we need to create sets of balances whose aggregate actually favors India's rise. But there is a third aspect to it, as a concept. And that is a kind of a grand strategy which looks over the horizon. Because if we are to be a leading power one day, if we are to have a strategy that is truly grand, then one has to not plan for today or tomorrow, but for the next generation, maybe even beyond that. And if you look at many of our initiatives in the last decade, the focus on Latin America, the reach out to the CARICOM, the interest in the Pacific Islands, the involvement with new connectivity initiatives, I would suggest to you that this is an India that is actually planning at least a generation ahead, trying to expand its footprint, however lightly, but it will be a beginning, and beginnings, at the end of the day, are the start of processes.

So I think to the elements which he has added, I think if we visualize the world in a much more focused way, in a much more actionable way, if we learn to play the world stage more adeptly, which is not without its risks and its anxieties, and if we actually look over the horizon, I think you have the makings here of what would be, in a sense, a multi-generational foreign policy. Now what are the key issues that such a foreign policy would look at? And I think in all frankness, I mean, they are a mix of the old and new, the issues that we have historically confronted, many of them have not gone away. We have yet to secure our borders, we are still combating terrorism on a very serious scale, so there are the hangovers of the past. There are the requirements of the present. We have already, again, I would say, moved to a foreign policy which is much more directly tasked to advance national development. If you actually look at all the joint communiques, what the foreign policy apparatus puts out, you would actually see, in the last 10 years, much greater stress on economic diplomacy. When prime ministers or even foreign ministers go out, there is much more about technology, capital, best practices, collaborations, investments. These actually occupy a much larger space in terms of what we do with other countries. And in that sense, I think we have taken some valuable lessons from other countries in Southeast Asia and East Asia, I think, who were doing it much longer than we were doing.

A third issue which we, today, I think I would put that as one of very high priority, which is supply chain reformulations. That the rerouting of supply chains today has both a foreign policy implication, but it also is a great national development opportunity. And that supply chain rerouting, the idea of more resilient, reliable supply chains, it can, in fact, it is already spurring manufacturing in this country, but it is also, in a way, a catalyst for technology growth in India. Talking of which, the digital era, I think, again has a foreign policy requirement of its own. Because the digital era is fundamentally different from the manufacturing era. The kind of hedging that could be done in manufacturing, at the end of the day, products were products. Whereas something digital is not just a product anymore. It is a data emitter. So we have today to build into our economics, but certainly our global partnerships, the sense of trust and transparency as a factor. So often now it is not a question of who is competitively priced. It is also very much an issue of whose products and services you trust. Where would you like your data to be? Where are other people likely to use your data against you? I think these are all concerns which will be important.

Flowing from that, I think there is a new reality, another new reality which is happening, which is a global workplace. That if one looks in terms of Indians working abroad, it is growing in leaps and bounds. In many cases, in individual relationships in the last few years, it has grown by hundreds of thousands. So it is interesting today that the countries where there is a large Indian population are no longer those where it was 10 years ago or 20 years ago. And this is likely to change much faster. As a ballpark figure, there are, I think, about 33-34 million Indian nationals and persons of Indian origin working abroad. So even if one leaves out persons of Indian origin, that still gives us something like 17-18 million people who are working abroad, and I assure you, these numbers are going to go up dramatically in the coming years. In fact, probably the most frequent conversations I have today, particularly with my counterparts and other ministers in developed countries, is actually about mobility. So we are going to see an explosion in mobility because there will be a demand for talent coupled with very sharp demographic deficits in different parts of the world. So that too is a change which is waiting to happen.

Then I mention connectivity. Now, again, we inherited the disrupted connectivity of the colonial times, and really for many decades we have not made a great effort to rebuild or resurrect the pre-colonial connectivity. And that has worked to our disadvantage. So today, if you look, look to the west. I mean, we have the India-Middle East Economic Corridor. Yes, it has challenges right now, but it's very clear that everybody is very determined to take that forward. There is also the International North-South Transport Corridor, which has a different set of partners. If one looks to the east, you have the trilateral highway, which the ambitious form of it will actually end up somewhere in the Gulf of Tonkin. So when you put all these connectivity initiatives in place, and they do take years sometimes, maybe a decade to realize, actually the world is going to be very, very different. And for India it's going to be very, very different, because a lot of this connectivity is going to run through India.

And then I would say, if one again looks at the world order, the world order itself no longer encourages fixed point collaborations. Depending on the agenda, you have a different combination of countries. So you can have an India in the QUAD, you can have an India in the BRICS, you can have it in the SCO. We can lead the Global South, we can be present at G7 meetings. So how do you find, how do you actually fashion your foreign policy to maximize your involvement in issues, your presence in different regions, and your shaping of multiple outcomes? So it calls for a different kind of flexibility and nimbleness, in a way. And moving beyond that, I think, again, I come back to the capability point. We are today a country of whom there are greater expectations, a country which actually has greater responsibilities. So the idea of India as a first responder, I can predict will actually get more and more frequent. I mean, pretty much anything in the expanded neighbourhood region, I think there would be an expectation that in some way, India be part of an international response whenever such a thing is warranted.

And finally, of course, because the world is changing, there will be new ideas, there will be new initiatives. We have already seen, I mean, QUAD is a good example; IMEC is an example of another, or the International Solar Alliance, or indeed the I2U2 in the Middle East. So the whole sort of construct, in a way, is going to be more open architecture, more multiple choices, but much deeper involvement, many more complex decisions, in a way. It's very hard to predict how it's going to go, but I can tell you how one thing is for sure, that the kind of defensive crouch into which we had, for a variety of reasons, got into, that era is really decisively behind us. I think we have to do very much more with the world. I think it's for the good of this country that our own progress and development will accelerate with a deeper engagement with the world.

So my sense for a foreign policy ahead would really be to think big, to think long, but to think smart. So that, I hope, are concepts which, in some way or the other, I find reflected in the volume, in the issues to come. Once again, I congratulate all those for whom this labor of love has finally materialized, and really, I must say, I would be your initial public reader, and I can tell you the reader's response is a very good one.

So, thank you very much."

Ambassador Ms. Ana Taban,

Distinguished guests,

Excellencies,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Good evening!

It is an honour to be with you all today as we mark a significant milestone in relations between the Republic of India and the Republic of Moldova—the official inauguration of the Moldovan Embassy in New Delhi.

This moment reflects the shared commitment of our nations, especially since establishing diplomatic ties in 1992. What stands out in our journey together is our unwavering support for each other on the global stage, in multilateral institutions, and in addressing international challenges like climate change and sustainable development. Moldova extended crucial help during Operation Ganga to evacuate stranded Indian citizens during the Ukraine crisis. We in India will never forget it.

As we contemplate a deeper engagement with Europe, it is natural we focus on various bilateral relationships. We have witnessed growing engagement between our countries, spanning trade, education, technology, and cultural exchanges. Moldova’s warm embrace of Indian yoga traditions, the Hindi language and Indian culture, is a testament to our close people-to-people ties. Moldova is a second home to over 2,000 Indian students. These young individuals embody the essence of our partnership, bridging cultures and forging lasting friendships.

In recent years, India has cultivated dynamic relationships with European nations in trade, technology, tourism, education, energy, healthcare, and cultural exchanges grounded in mutual respect and shared values. Moldova is an integral part of this; we are also development partners.

Establishing a Moldovan presence in India’s vibrant capital is a practical step forward in strengthening our diplomatic ties and promoting collaboration in key areas of mutual interest. It is a testament to our shared vision of a world that values peace, understanding, and cooperation. We believe this new chapter will further enhance partnerships in these areas.

As we celebrate this inauguration, let us renew our commitment to a future built on mutual respect and shared goals. May this embassy become a beacon of friendship. Let’s celebrate our shared aspirations and a commitment to a future of deeper collaboration. I also hope that we will open an Indian Mission in Moldova in the coming years, which will strengthen our growing partnership further.

On behalf of the Government and people of India, I extend my warmest congratulations to the people and government of Moldova, the Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, and the first resident Moldovan Ambassador in New Delhi.

Thank you."
"Ministry of External Affairs
Government of India","December 15, 2024","Greetings to all of you. I would have liked very much to be at this function today. One, because of my deep regard for Prof. Arvind Panagariya. And two, since his most recent work: ""The Nehru Development Model”: is of particular interest to me.

2. In 1947, John Foster Dulles famously declared: ""In India, Soviet Communism exercises a strong influence through the interim Hindu Government.” He, of course, could not have been more wrong, about ascribing that adjective, to the then Government. But more relevant, this was an assertion, that for decades, was treated as a geo-political overreaction of American policy makers, to an independent India. I myself was schooled to believe this, as I first studied, and then practiced international relations. But over the years, I have often asked myself whether Dulles was altogether wrong on this matter. And in Prof. Panagariya’s book, I found a substantial answer to that concern.

3. Now, we all know that there was a strong ideological drive to advance a particular economic model for an India that had just gained its freedom. The belief which propelled it was modulated from time to time, but never fundamentally changed. Its root cause was an analysis that the only counter to imperialism lay in socialism. Not just in general terms, but one particular paradigm that was centered around heavy industry. For that reason, the author actually characterized it as a Nehru Development Model. Now, this may have worked for the USSR; or at least it appeared to do so then. The problem was that India was not the USSR.

4. In effect, Prof. Panagariya suggests that Nehru’s choices set India on a deterministic path. The model and its accompanying narratives permeated our politics, the bureaucracy, of course the planning system, the judiciary, the public space including media, and most of all, teaching. Think about it: both Russia and China today, reject unambiguously, the economic assumptions of that period, which they did more than anyone else, to propagate. Yet, these beliefs appear to live-on with influential sections of our country even today. Certainly, after 2014, there has been a vigorous effort towards course correction. But the author does suggest – with good reason – that it still remains an uphill task.

5. A Nehru Development Model inevitably produced a Nehru Foreign Policy. We seek to correct that abroad, just as we try to reform the consequences of the model at home. In fact, the resistance to one is based on an attachment to the other. In my view, the two need to be tackled as an integral whole. The paradox is, that for more than three decades now, there is actually a national consensus, that this development model eventually failed the country. Yet, there is a reluctance to confidently explore alternatives. As a result, we usually end up doing the reforms we must, rarely the reforms we should.

6. Prof. Panagariya is an ardent advocate of an open economy. I bring up that subject because this development model essentially negated it. There is no question that India has benefited from greater openness in the last 33 years. But the situation today is very much more complex than before. We live in an era of weaponized economics, one that throws up questions as to what exactly we are exposing abroad, and to whom. This is aggravated by increasingly technology-centric growth and high data sensitivity. The key concepts, therefore, today are less of openness, and more of resiliency, reliability, redundancy and trust. In the debates that understandably take place in this domain, perhaps ‘openness with caution’ is a better approach.

7. This volume also raises a related issue of conceptual openness. It is essential to have a sound grasp of international affairs. But transporting mechanically concepts and ideologies, as this book suggests, also comes with a cost. Atma nirbharta should not be taken as a synonym for protectionism. It is actually a call to think and act for ourselves, as much as it is to ensure national security.

8. I thank you all for your attention and congratulate Prof. Panagariya on this valuable endeavour."
