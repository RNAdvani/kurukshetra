{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"Well, firstly I'll make the point that in large part the point of the microaggression sheet was to make people aware of things they might be doing unintentionally. So to some extent it's facilitating discussion of these viewpoints by making people more aware of what messages they might be sending. Another point is that, although you are right in saying that colleges and universities generally shouldn't be discouraging certain viewpoints, they might be justified in discouraging certain ways of expressing them if those viewpoints themselves have a chilling effect on speech. Obviously, in its benign context, the view that a qualified individual should get the job does not have such an effect. But in the more sinister context, the same phrase is heavily loaded and can actually hinder free discussion of the issue. By couching the anti-affirmative action viewpoint in such commonsense terms, the proponent of that viewpoint is framing the affirmative action side as absurd. You yourself (IIRC) have asked people in this thread if they would rather a less-qualified individual get the job. I think it should be obvious that proponents of affirmative action don't want a bunch of incompetent people to get all the jobs (or places in universities) just because of their membership in a protected class, and forcing us to argue that claim can be inordinately frustrating without serving any rhetorical purpose. Especially when a proponent of affirmative action is likely to be a member of a protected class, for whom speaking out against the status quo can be intimidating, framing your argument in such a \"gotcha!\" manner is bad for debate. Lastly, I think that the \"real world\" cares a lot more about peoples' feelings than you think. It's a common trope that once college students get out into the labor force that all the supposed mollycoddling being done on campus is going to come back to bite them, but I honestly don't think this is a realistic portrayal of what the working world is like now. Anyone who's ever dealt with an HR department will know what I mean. Corporations and businesses know that fostering an environment that is completely uncaring towards how their workers feel will not only open them up to civil liability, it will lower productivity. To that end, lots of companies seek to foster a professional environment where offensive speech is not tolerated. Perhaps the better preparation would be for those who desire to speak in whatever manner they choose without expecting any repercussion to learn that the real world doesn't operate that way either.","output":"You make some good points. Facilitating a conversation on hiring methods and strategies is a good thing. Discussing benefits of diversity in the workplace is a good thiing. My argument is that the way they did it was wrong. IMO what they should have done was given lecturers a guide on how to deal with that argument and how to facilitate the conversation more effectively. Colouring the phrase as a potential micro aggression to be avoided doesnt improve the discussion. If you use the starting point of: You can't say that in this context because it might hurt feelings\/intimidate others then you're shutting down that branch of the discussion. Again, equipping students and lecturers with the tools and the confidence to speak up and argue against that point of view is much more valuable, not just in this instance but those tools will benefit them going forward in a variety of situations. They're current policy doesnt do this and causes everyone to miss out on a chance to learn something valuable and thats not what a university should be aiming to do. Ive been working for most of the last 16 years, Ive worked for several companies and dealt with hundreds more. I've never come across any company (bar the very small ones) who genuinely cared about employees feelings. The extent to which they care is limited to: avoiding civil liability, avoiding problems that could effect productivity. If someone comes to them and says they have hurt feelings because of someone elses beliefs on affirmative action, chritsmas, politics, war or whatever then thats not something they'll deal with. If you look at what happened at Yale where the students were outraged over the letter where an administrator posed the question of whether students should police their own costumes you'll see what I mean. That kind of reaction is not acceptable in the real world. is the one I'm talking about. Someone disagrees with the girl in a calm manner and she freaks out and starts screaming at him and calls him disgusting for not having the same opinion as her. When people talk about how these students are being molly coddled and aren't prepared for the real world, this is what they're referring to. This isn't one outlier, this is something thats cropped up several times in the last few months alone. You could argue the idea that she'd know not to speak to her boss, coworkers or customers in this manner...but wouldn't someone who knew that also know not to talk to a college administrator in that way?"}

Seminaries are supposed to turn down and even encourage straight priests to leave (at least temporarily) if they are struggling with being chaste and continent. Being gay was taboo, so the subject was never really brought up and the document prohibiting homosexuals from entering seminaries was in my mind not that but rather a reminder to Bishops that men are sometimes also attracted to men and that this is a legitimate struggle just as much as any straight man trying to come to grips with chastity. The document also touched on the fact that a seminary will be full (or at least somewhat populated) by young men, which is not the easiest situation for another young gay man who wants to live chastely. I kid you not, there was a seminary near the college I went to that installed windows to the hallway that could not be covered so that bedrooms would not be private places in the 80's because they had so much trouble with gay seminarians who were just hooking up. Obviously this was exaggerated because of homophobia, but it was a problem nonetheless.

Nearly all agreed that Princeton hadn\u2019tstarted it; but 86% of Princeton students believed that Dartmouth had started it, whereas only 36% of Dartmouth students blamed Dartmouth. (Most Dart- mouth students believed \u201cboth started it.\u201d) There\u2019s no reason to think this was a cheer, as opposed to a real belief. The students were probably led by their different beliefs to make different predictions about the behavior of players in future games. And yet somehow the perfectly ordinary factual beliefs at Dartmouth were wildly different from the perfectly ordinary factual beliefs at Princeton. Can we blame this on the different sources Dartmouth and Princeton students had access to? On its own, bias in the different news sources that groups rely on is a pretty serious problem.

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"As I say, I'm not trying to say that people should or shouldn't take psychedelics really, and I'm certainly not trying to judge people who use them either for recreation or for potential treatment benefits. Depression sucks, and I don't even judge people who commit suicide to get away from it so I certainly don't judge people who use other drugs in hopes to get better either. All I'm saying is that I don't think that it should be encouraged for people to use as a 'cure' or fix for depression - or other serious disorders - at this point. Not because I don't believe that it's had benefits for you or other people - I do believe that - but because I just think that there is still a lot of unknowns and there are currently some pretty big risks to it's use because of how it's distributed and unregulated and that shouldn't be discounted or underplayed. There actually hasn't been that much research into these. Most of the studies that have been done have been pretty limited in participants and in time span, as well as having some other design flaws that limit how conclusive they are on this subject. There are still some pretty big question marks about what effects these could have, especially if used long term, and about what exact effect they actually have on depression, specifically. The fact that these drugs have been used in society for a long time does not mean necessarily that they are not harmful or are totally safe. Much the same could be said about cocaine before there was formalized research on it - it was largely hailed as great and a fix to many problems - and yet, we've learned a lot of its potential consequences through research. If we couldn't even figure out that cocaine was highly addictive and damaging then I think that it's not entirely unlikely that we could be missing important effects that psychedelics are having.","output":"Again, we do know a decent amount about how these drugs work on the brain. There were tons of clinical studies that came out of the 60s that are still accessible. Thousands of documented sessions with positive results. The thing is we don't know much about the brain itself. Like I said, we hardly know how antidepressants work. And comparing psychedelics with cocaine is nonsense because of the known pharmacology. The research continuously points to serotogenic psychedelics being one of the safest drugs you can consume, if not the safest, physically at least. Mentally that depends on how the person uses and reacts to it, and thats why us people who encourage them are here for. To tell them to start small, and give them tips to guide them to a good experience. And like I said before, who are the people encouraging psychedelic use? They're a bunch of Internet people who've had lasting benefits from using them, and if you were apart of the community of users you'd see that negative effects are not nearly as prevalent as people claim. Almost every single bad trip is a result of bad set or setting, wrong intention, mixing drugs (especially weed), or taking too much. If someone were to take 50 micrograms of LSD to see how they react to it, it is highly unlikely they will have a bad trip. And such a low dose could still be therapeutic. And how does marijuana factor into this as well? There is a good amount of research, but also were still learning how it affects the brain. But is it only ok now because the government said so for some states? Maybe marijuana will be like cocaine too and we just haven't figured it out yet? By all known current means it seems benign enough to allow people to them. The same with psychedelic, although you have to take a few more precautions than for smoking weed. So we should work with what we know now. We'll never be absolutely sure of anything. Also a big reason why people promote them is that they have the potential to change the way you think entirely. They promote thinking that is individual, yet planetary focused. You experience empathy and understand to the point where you actually can't tell the difference between yourself and the person in front of you. Psychedelics showed me what unconditional love means, and showed me ways that I could help bring that into reality. Many of these realization are at odds with current power structures and hierarchies of authority, and much of why we promote this is because of the individual and social change that can be brought out about it. Say what you want about the 60s but that was a massive social change that affected the way we live today entirely which we take for granted. So in many ways it's a rebellious act, that should be thought of as such because it's the individual taking control of himself against a dominating force who would have him put in prison for taking a substance to treat his mental illness. So I encourage use, but I encourage safe use. People like me are trying to take the job the DARE campaign should have taken. Actually educating people and letting them decide for themselves. No fear tactics, not promoting abstinence only, not equating all drugs to heroin. Just working with the evidence at hand and making educated assumptions."}

Therefore libertarian reforms would lead to less deaths. It takes the market out of criminal hands.","output":"That's true to an extent, but I think a little optimistic. Prescription drugs manufactured under the careful watch of the FDA kill more people each year than street drugs.

I'd argue that government is only as good as its ability to align its actions with the will of its people, for better or worse. The solution to \"bad\" elected officials should be to educate and empower voters to make better choices (e.g. voting days are holidays, more transparent and available election information, public education that includes Political history, etc) - not place further limitations\/qualifications on candidates or the voice of certain voters.

In other words, despite the actual quality of the applicant, people with black sounding names were getting far fewer call backs. That is pretty strong evidence of a systemic bias in hiring practice.

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"CMV: Those who buy from telemarketers are responsible for the existence of telemarketers.","output":"TL;DR: Telemarketing serves some purposes other than just the occasional purchase they generate. Those other purposes are, usually, more important. The full explanation is in the word: telemarketing. It's a form of marketing, not sales. They're not there to create leads and make a sale; telemarketers serve the exact same purpose as a highway billboard with a phone number at the bottom. They are there to increase awareness of the brand in the (sub)consciousness of the person being called. They are there to make people think of this brand more easily when they think of this kind of product, or to make them aware that a solution exists for XYZ problem the product is supposed to solve. The vast majority of telemarketing would still exist for quite a while even if tomorrow, all together, the entire human population stopped buying from them. The \"problem\" of telemarketing is generally a rather intricate game-theoretic problem. There are individuals in a collective, and for every individual (save a rare few), things would be net better if there were no telemarketers, as telemarketers impose a sort of cognitive tax on them. So collectively, also, we would want there to be no telemarketers. But as some subgroups, we do want more money (the exchange rates between \"money\" and aforementioned \"cognitive tax\" are extremely strange, but they can be quantified on an individual level with enough work), which therefore makes it Nash equilibria that some subgroups will employ telemarketers (since they're getting more money as individual members of that group, and also because if no one else was doing it they'd be making money without being telemarket-taxed), and others will work as telemarketers (again, money + minor personal savings on the tax by not being telemarketed by this telemarketer subgroup). There is a Pareto optimum where no telemarketers exist, but it is not strictly across-the-board superior to the Nash equilibrium for many subgroups -- in fact, for every subgroup that can employ telemarketers, it is strictly better for them individually to use telemarketers. Not sure I've explained the game theory all too well. Overall, though, the issue is that once you reach down to the decision point of the person buying from a telemarketer, you are in a subgame where if you do want that product, it's strictly superior to buy the product, compared to not buying, or wasting more time buying from elsewhere."}

He wants to call those friends more often! Those friends should stop doing that, they are causing him to keep calling them.","output":"Those friends should stop doing that, they are causing him to keep calling them. Are you doing this on purpose? Let's continue the story, then. Bobby's friends stopped coming whenever he called them, because they don't want to hear about his RAPTOR toy on the phone anymore. Bobby's friends still go play with him most of the time, just not right after he calls them. Bobby stops calling his friends. Now that Bobby stopped calling them, his friends gradually start forgetting about him, so less and less of them are coming to play with him. Bobby starts calling them again. No one wants to come play with Bobby immediately (they still remember how bad that turned out). Yet, Bobby notices that now that he's started calling them again, more of them are coming to the regular play sessions, even though it's not right after he calls them. Bobby concludes that his calls must be making them come more often to the regular play sessions, so he keeps calling them so that they come to the regular play sessions, not to make them come over immediately. Your every sentence seems to assumes the telemarketing, on-call purchases are the only possible cause of why someone would make telemarketing calls. This is blatantly false, and if you don't understand why you'll need to take a basic economics course and, preferably, start learning the very basics of marketing. Ads never, ever, create enough direct sales to justify their cost, yet they still exist. Why is that? Because they increase awareness, which increases later overall purchases. Bobby's calls serve the same purpose, above. The argument that direct purchases increase telemarketing is valid. However, that does not mean a removal of direct purchases would eliminate telemarketing -- some telemarketing would survive even if on-call purchases were completely eliminated. As a thought experiment, imagine what would happen if the US made phone purchases a felony, punishable by a minimum of twenty years of prison. Would companies suddenly stop calling people altogether, just because now there's no one buying on the phone? No, they'd keep calling. You would still have telemarketers, they just wouldn't even try to sell you anything on the phone anymore, and would invite you to enter their name on the online form when you go make your purchase later."}

The better metric to capture what we're talking about is to look to see whether there is a systemic bias where female actors capture a smaller percentage of their movies' profits than similarly situated male actors. Then, if male casts pull in greater revenue than female casts, we have to separate it out to ask what percentage of the problem is caused by audiences (not exactly in studios' control) and what is caused by devoting less production\/distribution\/marketing resources towards movies with female castmembers.

The courts have ruled time and again that, while Constitutional rights are natural rights which cannot be removed from an individual without due process of law, rights can be subject to \"reasonable\" restrictions in order to preserve the rights of all. Here's a hypothetical. Lets say we have a city square which doesn't require a permit to rally or protest in. In this square a group of congregants from a local synagogue have decided to rally so that their voices might be heard by the public. However, a local Klan chapter catches wind of this and is able to mobilize to the same location, on the same day, at the same time, with double the people. They Klan hosts a counter demonstration in the same exact location as the Jewish folks. Now the question is who has the greater right to speak freely and have their voices heard? The Klan because the have more people? The answer is they both have the same right and the best way to ensure that they both are able to say what they want is via a permitting system. As long as permits cannot be denied for reasons other than schedule conflicts they do not inherently limit free speech and, in fact, can serve to ensure that everyone has the ability to speak freely."}

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"CMV: birth control should be covered by health insurance","output":"Free speech is the first amendment right? So how come the government doesn't fund people starting up their own newspaper articles? The problem here is that taxpayer money shouldn't really be going into healthcare as a whole. That's what health insurance companies are there for. If our taxpayer money is not going towards birth control, than I think we then must pay for the healthcare of any child born from an accidental pregnancy, whose parents don't have the means to support that child. In all honesty is a completely one sided entitled argument. If you're having sex with someone else, it's your own choice. No ones holding a gun to your head and telling you that you need to have sexual intercourse with your significant other or some random person on the street. You need to face the possible consequences of your actions. It's not societies job to fund your baby now with taxpayer dollars because you made a mistake of using bad contraceptives or didn't use one to begin with. That's for me where the argument falls apart. You have to hold people accountable for their own actions. Getting the government to support \"accidental\" mothers removes the punishment for having sex and getting pregnant. A person cannot afford birth control and therefore has unprotected sex. They end up with a child that they didn't necessarily want. They are still poor, and therefore unable to pay for health care for that child. Therefore, that child is being payed for by our taxpayer dollars. We must support that child for 18 years, instead of paying for pills, shots, or some rubber, all of which are significantly cheaper than a child. Won't the community paying for birth control allow more children to live quality lives, while we pay less? You mean a person didn't bother going to the convenience store pick up a pack of condoms and used double just in case? What a shock. To be fair I do agree there are circumstances in which women end up having to bear the burden such as rape. But these cases are not the norm. No. The child shouldn't be supported by tax payer dollars. Either the parent finds a way to nourish their child through hardships or send the child up for adoption. There's a fucking reason why you go through a boat load hoops and boundaries to adopt a child It's not everyone else's job to pay for that person's mistake. The reason why I believe this is the same reason why we punish and talk into our children when they do bad things. I'm not talking the physical type of punishment. If you don't like being punished, then don't make poor decisions. It's that simple. If you want to help someone else raise their child, go start a go-fund me page or a foundation. Get people who are willing to get on board to help out. Don't force people to do it using tax payer dollars. That's morally wrong and evil. Now, I do believe that this could all be avoided simply by people having less sex, but IMO, we have not found an effective way to limit the amount of sex people are having. This is where we both agree. But honestly it's their choice. You can't force someone not to have sex because of the complications it might bring afterwards. You can teach people to use safer practices but at the end of the day, you can't fix stupid. -------------------------------------------- I'm not super hardcore about this, but since this is a CMV I wanted to give you a conservative take on your post You have to see that there are two sides to this story.

I think that workplaces should be REQUIRED to give a minimum of at least ten minutes for a break. Passing a law or other requirement is always a bad idea, because you are forcing others to follow your idea. This isn't nice. I work on lawsuits involving employees who have not been given their meal breaks or rest breaks according to [California] law. Ironically, many employees don't want to take their meal and rest breaks. The issue is prominent enough that the California Supreme Court ruled that employers needed to offer breaks, but not require that their employees take them. Note that California is a very employee-friendly state, so this ruling, which is in favor of employers is very unusual. Here are some examples where you don't always want your rest breaks or meal breaks. 1. Wait Staff at a restaurant: You don't want to take a break and lose the tips on the tables that you've been waiting on. 2. Truck drivers: Many drivers are paid 'by the mile', so you are forcing them to reduce their salary against their will. 3. \"Paper Pushers\": You are required to complete the government paperwork for 15 companies per month. If you are in the middle of one, you don't want to have to stop in the middle, and lose 10-15 minutes, plus another 10-15 minutes remembering where you are. Not requiring breaks means that employees can control their work environment. 4. Almost any sales force: Any job paid on commission, you want to be available as much of the time as possible. A law is forcing people to lose sales, or provide lower quality service. Even at your fast food restaurant, could you tell a customer \"I'm sorry, I can't help you, I'm required to take a break?\" Your job probably has several other people that could help at any time. Now imagine that you are the only person who could help. That customer is going to be pissed - and you are going to lose money because of it. 5. Piece work: #2 and #4 are two examples where your pay is directly related to the work you perform. But there are many other examples where employees are paid for piece work. Would you want to tell your employees who need some extra money \"No, it's against the law for you to work through your lunch or break.\" TL:DR; It would be good if you had the option, but don't make everybody follow your good idea."}

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"Here is the paper: Here we have the research team's own words: Still, it remains possible that men and women in our sample did have different values or made different choices. It is possible that men prioritized compensation more than women did. Of note, we studied a select group of highly accomplished individuals who chose academic careers rather than more lucrative positions in the private sector, so pay in general is not expected to be a high priority. Yet perhaps these researchers still internalized to some degree society's gendered expectations of career success, with men more likely to value pay.25 As a result, women may have made trade-offs in compensation to achieve nonmonetary benefits. For example, women may have been more likely to choose institutions that successfully offered lower salaries because of a location in or near a desirable community. The women in our sample were less likely to move to a new institution, and we controlled for this in our analysis, but it is possible that they were also less willing or able to make credible threats to leave their institutions, for which we did not control. Women have, in other studies, been shown to negotiate less aggressively regarding salary than men.26 We do not have information on employment status of the respondents' spouses, so we cannot ascertain whether spousal employment may have mediated the salary difference observed. This study has a number of strengths, including its focus on a homogeneous population in whom gender differences are particularly unexpected and its consideration of a large array of measures of productivity and other factors to which gender differences might be attributed. The study has certain limitations, however. Like any survey study, it is vulnerable to selection bias. Although the response rate was high, it is nevertheless possible that respondents were not similar to the overall target population. Reassuringly, analyses comparing respondents with the overall cohort of K awardees from 2000-2003 suggested few systematic differences. Item nonresponse regarding salary was not negligible, and there were meaningful differences between those who chose to respond to the salary item and those who did not, but there were not differences by gender, and sensitivity analysis using weighted data produced similar findings. Finally, this study, like most studies of physician compensation, relies largely on self-report for its measures. Although the questions used were developed with standard techniques of survey design, including cognitive pretesting, and have high face validity, it is possible that recall or other biases influenced response. Nevertheless, there is little reason to suspect that such biases would affect the identification of gender differences. Here is the lead physician's own words: Dr. Jagsi believes that greater transparency would decrease, and even eliminate, the income differences. Currently, it is difficult for most doctors to know if they are being paid fairly \u201csince most institutions don\u2019t have clear policies on how to determine salaries,\u201d she noted. But standardizing the process of compensation and career advancement would make everyone involved more accountable for such decisions and \u201callow men and women to be paid as much as the work they are doing is worth,\u201d she said. \u201cSociety makes a huge investment in every medical trainee,\u201d Dr. Jagsi said. \u201cIf we make that kind of investment, we need to ensure that compensation and advancement are fair.\u201d Far from a slam dunk, in my opinion. I'm not convinced one way or the other on the paygap myth, but the issue is a conclusive study on the subject is almost certainly going to be impossible because one cannot correct for all of these various factors as listed above.","output":"It might not be a slam dunk but I think it's pretty darn close to a clean 3-pointer swish through the hoop without touching the rim. 1) So if a person values pay more, it's somehow okay to pay them more for equal work? Hm... 2) I understand the point about nonmonetary benefits, but the researchers do state that this is likely because the woman prefer staying at home institutions and this might be because of poorer negotiation skills which brings me to: 3) I do agree that women negotiate less aggressively. But isn't this still a poor explanation for the disparity in income? It's like saying blacks tend to fill most of our prisons; while this may be because they do commit more crimes, it certainly doesn't explain all arrests. And it's not because of their skin color that makes them more criminal. And again, does negotiating less aggressively mean that you deserve to be paid less...again, for equal work? 4) \"There is little reason to suspect that such biases would affect the identification of gender differences.\" 5) The lead physician believes in greater transparency and more objective evaluation of physicians. This just proves that Dr. Jagsi does believe in the paygap. Similar to how, when given the chance to have blind auditions for female musicians, surprise! More females were hired because evidently the people hiring sometimes couldn't believe a woman could play, say, a french horn just as well as a man. While it's probably impossible to hide one's gender when working in a hospital, Dr. Jagsi is advocating similar fairness in evaluations. More readings if you're interested: The pay gap also exists among women without children: This analysis, finds that even after controlling for occupation, industry, hours, work experience, college major, religion, race\/ethnicity, GPA, education, number of children and marital status, women are paid only 82 percent of what their male peers are earning just a year after college graduation. Race has to do with it too. There's a pay gap for minorities as well. Which, of course, makes lots of sense."}

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"Climate changes are inevitable. Even with the impact we will have, in the long term scale it will get far hotter and far colder than we are going to make things. I agree completely. But I'm talking about the potential for drastic climate effects in the short term which will have catastrophic consequences for human civilization. As for phytoplankton, they know that it has been decreasing but there are multiple theories as to why it is happening (all of them relate to climate change, but not all have to do with acidification). Part of this problem, and it's well established, is that increasing acidifcation of the ocean reduces the bioavailability of trace nutrients which are crucial to the development of phytoplankton. Calcium aside, iron is the limiting factor in phytoplankton growth which, of course, is one of the minerals which becomes less bioavailable. More than that is the fact that cyanobacteria in the ocean rely upon bioavailable iron to be able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which in turn becomes nutrients for phytoplankton. It's not as simple as just hoping that phytoplankton which are more resistant to acidic environments will take over, there are limits to acidity due to chemical reasons. But say there is a serious shift in ocean acidity and lots of phytoplankton die off as other phytoplankton adapt, there will be huge impacts all the way up the food chain because of this shift which will have a dramatic effect on food production for people. This increased demand for food would likely destabilize countries and cause famines\/refugee crises, and it would also put extra strain on current food production which is in itself unsustainable. The way evolution works means that as the phytoplankton that can't survive the lower pH start to die, the survivors will have more nutrients which will make them thrive and grow more. As mentioned above, there are points where the nutrients will either stop being bioavailable for phytoplankton or photosynthesizing bacteria, either of which will be devastaing. I don't think we can count on life, uh, finding a way. Especially not if we are planning to have civilization survive more or less intact. As for your comments about changes in weather patterns and peat bogs, you again seem to indicate that this will all happen at once and neglect to mention that increased CO2 levels will lead to increased vegetation (we are already seeing this). Well peat bogs are very delicate ecosystems that will release huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere if they are drained or damaged. If we get to a point were we are impacting on peat bogs, then we are going to see huge carbon emissions because these bogs hold about 1\/3 of all the carbon stored on land, which is approximately 1\/2 of the current atmospheric carbon. It wouldn't take the loss of 10% of peat bogs to undermine a reduction in carbon emissions. As for arable land, we will see a lot more of it in places like Russia, Greenland, and Canada, while GMOs are making it easier to grow in a wider range of environments. In fact, we are likely to see an increase in farmland and crop production for a while due to climate change. But the problem isn't that we can't produce enough food, it's that the way we produce and transport food is inherently unsustainable. And even if, and that's a big if, we can increase food production or maintain it, that's still relying on stable weather patterns and it's not a longer term solution. The real problem isn't a resource constraint as you imply, it is the change I mentioned. Places that are used to monsoons don't get them, while places that are used to dry weather get monsoons. With enough time it will be easy enough to shift agricultural production (just like we can shift human populations in low lying cities with enough time), but how much time we will have will make the difference. Right. So we have ever-increasing carbon emissions and destruction of the natural environment, yet we need to be restoring the natural environment and to have ever-reducing carbon emissions. The change needs to be a massive one, and it needs to happen very soon. The problem is that there is no indication that we are even considering a halt, let alone a reversal. The other thing is that while monsoon regions are getting less monsoons, and vice versa etc. the real concern is that these climate patterns are becoming less stable and less predictable. It doesn't take too much rain or too much heat to suddenly ruin crops &amp;mdash; some foods take months to produce and at certain points they are very susceptible to changes in weather. An unexpected monsoon or drought could easily cause big problems in food production. All the while desertification is advancing at a frightful pace. As for California, most of their crops are specialty crops that shouldn't be grown there, and most of their drought is not due to climate change but classic lack of environmental conservation (i.e., overuse). I totally agree with this. And it's not the only place in the world that produces crops where it really shouldn't. But the thing is that we do it because it's profitable, not because it's sustainable or environmentally appropriate. And we keep doing all of these unsustainable things that we know are entirely unsustainable all because it's profitable. Yeah, we could change the situation of food production in California but to do that we would either need to re-engineer the local environment itself or we would need to change the entire economy (and probably the political system with it). I don't see any indication of either happening. If your key point is that we should take major action, I don't disagree. What I disagree with is the assertion that anything less than major action is almost pointless. Major action would buy us several decades or even centuries, lesser (yet still significant) action will buy us a few decades, and no action will mean things like moving cities and agricultural industries will have to be done every few years. I'm not saying that major action is pointless, I'm saying that the need for immense changes need to happen in the near future and that we are going in the opposite direction. Even if we stopped increasing carbon emissions today we would still be headed for huge problems. If halting carbon emissions where they are currently is a lesser action and yet we can't even seem to make progress towards that, then how could we possibly expect that we will make major action like reducing carbon emissions? And at the heart of this is the fact that once things become sufficiently unstable it's going to be too late to bring about any change because instead of long-term environmental plans we will be dealing with short-term crises, and it seems like it's going to take very tangible examples of the impacts of climate change before we will start dealing with it. By that point we will have either increased positive climate change feedback loops to the point that they will run away with themselves or we will be unable to address the climate change due to lack of resources\/political instability\/financial effects etc. When there's a shortage of food or water in a local area the stockpiling and even looting that happens instead of the measured and rational distribution of scarce resources causes more waste, misallocation of resources, and more destruction. On a large scale I don't see how countries which are constantly at one another's throats will act any differently when it comes to climate change.","output":"My background is in biochem, not climate science, so maybe there's something I'm missing here, but iron is the limiting factor in phytoplankton growth which, of course, is one of the minerals which becomes less bioavailable. doesn't jive with me. From (PDF download link) paper: Modern day oceans and lakes thus cater poorly to the Fe requirements of phytoplankton with surface waters bearing picomolar to nanomolar concentrations of dissolved unchelated inorganic iron, Fe' (Johnson et al., 1997), the most readily available form of Fe to phytoplankton, be it in ferrous Fe(II)' or ferric form Fe(III)' The paper focuses of ligand-bound, or chelated iron (FeL), but also recognizes Fe' as an important iron source. The thing is though, more acidic environments actually promote the oxidation of elemental iron to the +2\/+3 forms, and will have varying effects on the stability of FeL compounds. The organisms have many pathways for iron uptake, and acidification isn't going to result in wide-scale sequestration of iron (so far as I know), so there will still be around as much (if not more) bioavailable Fe for the phytoplankton. In fact, (ANother pdf, sorry) is a paper studying the subject, which found: we observed significant increases in dissolved iron concentrations, Fe(II) concentrations, and Fe(II) half-life times during and after the peak of blooms in response to CO 2 enrichment and concomitant lowering of pH, suggesting increased iron bioavailability. There are other considerations, such as the effect of pH on the bioavilability of other minerals (Zn, Mo), and the kinetics of certain pathways (N2 fixation, calcification), but it's by no means a mass die off or doomsday scenario. You seems skeptical of life finding a way, but adaption in microorganisms is ridiculously fast; and we're not even really talking about genome-level change, in most cases. Over the last 2 centuries, ocean pH has come down from about 8.2 to about 8.1. Unless that suddenly (10 years) drops by another .5, we're well within adaptability range. Re: Peat Bogs - what kind of time scale are you looking at here? Are you accounting for the dramatic increase in CO2 sequestration from algeal blooms and land vegation? Is this accounting for new peat bogs forming as a result of rising water levels? It should also be noted that simply drying a peat bog doesn't automatically release CO2 - but it does make stored CO2 more vulnerable to release from combustion\/oxidation. Though, in a dried bog, oxidation would be severely limited after the surface material becomes oxidized. Then there are projects like where people are actively working to restore peat bogs. As a final point, I'm not sure why you consider halting emissions to be a lesser action, when it's been impossible to do so, and will probably remain impossible for the next few decades. Until\/unless people get over their aversion to nuclear energy, fossil fuel processes are what we have to work with."}

Hipsters have this complex mindset where they wish to be a part of the counterculture and profess to not care if they don't fit in, but still secretly like the idea of people thinking about them or considering them to be interesting, whereas a poser cares about fitting in above all else."}

I believe our justice system should only do things which serve the greater good. Punishing someone to deter others from crime does that.

So if they fail to prove intent to kill, I get off scott-free. Woohoo.

By treating criminal acts in and of themselves as worthy of punishment, we affirm the societal belief that the act is indeed wrong. This isn't quite the same as general deterrence (a lengthy sentence to scare potential offenders from doing the same crime), but it still helps society by reminding us that the act is not okay. And if society decides that the act is in fact okay, then it eventually stops being illegal, so it's basically a two-way street in terms of societal benefit."}

The first is that, legally, Trayvon martin was considered a child in the state of Florida. Thus, calling him a child in the context of a criminal law proceeding makes plenty of sense. It is, after all, entirely correct. Second, the very fact that the legal definition of a child was written to encompass people under the age of 18 suggests that there is, in fact, a social consensus that such people are generally regarded as being children. Third, highlighting the fact serves to illustrate an important fact that is relevant to analyzing the case: Namely that Zimmerman is of an age that he is expected to behave rationally, an age that we socially recognize as being the age of majority, the age in which we are capable of making adult decisions. Meanwhile, Trayvon was of an age that we regard as being less rational, less adult, and generally less responsible. This distinction is highly relevant for assigning culpability in the face of the events that transpired. To ignore this fact would, if anything, be more disingenuous than highlighting it."}

Your comparison isn't really fair to me in the regard. You're comparing something with little variability (living in the wild) to something with immense variability (living in captivity). Obviously living in a zoo is much different than being a factory farmed cow. Even if you only compare zoo animals, how do you know one zoo is treating the animals well over another zoo? The last thing I'll ask you to consider however is the spectrum of intelligence. Recently, sea world decided to stop keeping orcas in captivity, not only because often these creatures were not treated well, but because orcas are extremely intelligent creatures, and it's morally wrong to keep them in captivity as a performance creature. So in addition to the question of \"are they being treated well\" is \"can they feel depressed simply from being in captivity.\" I think there's plenty of evidence to suggest that they do feel depressed. So basically there's a few questions i would ask: what animals are we talkong about? Wild cow vs. farmed cow? Wild cow is \"better off\". Wild lion vs. lion in well maintained and ethical zoo? Maybe the lion is \"better off\" but even then, do you know that he feels better off? Is it an animal that is in captivity and used for performance? If so I'll take being wild over being a performance animal all day. Lastly as an aside, I beg you to look up how fucked up the meat industry is in this country.

If you believe that people must 'will what they will' for it to be considered free, then I could just use your initial objection to the deterministic universe, and apply it here. That is, if you 'will what you will', where is that initial will coming from? It needs to be willed into being as well. We have an infinite regression here - the definition of free will isn't even really coherent. Rather, I think free will is a process that we go though. This process in fact: \"The brain uses input to reach decisions in set, chemical ways and translates this to output.\" That process is your free will. It's what makes your choices different from, say, a rock rolling down the hill. Both processes are deterministic. But the rock just rolls. Your brain does some sort of computations and runs a decision making process. Now defining exactly what makes your brain different from that rock is a little more tricky."}

Well, a government is a structure, with a bunch of roles that are then filled out by human elements. However, the type of elements that fill the roles are likely to be power-hungry and greedy, at a bare minimum. These traits are selected for by any structure which rewards the acquisition of power (anyone who is willing to be unconstrained by ethics has a powerful advantage over a moral opponent). We'll call these subversive elements. There is no way to filter subversive elements out, simply because there is no way to accurately determine from the outside whether someone is subversive pretending to be good, or simply good. Therefore, any structure will inevitably be filled with subversives. You can specify people to start, but eventually you will die and no longer be around. You can appoint an heir -- but you have no way to determine whether the heir is good or subversive. You can't create any kind of regulating body because it has to be filled out with people, and again, you have no way to determine whether they are good or not. You could cripple the government, such that it doesn't matter who has power, because there isn't any power. Unfortunately, that simply doesn't work, as history has shown us. So here's what you do. You exploit the psychology of the subversives. Divide and conquer. Split the subversives (and the power, as a result) along artificially drawn lines and aim the resulting groups at each other. Tell them that the other group is evil and horrible for having certain beliefs. Encourage each group form its own identity separate from the others. What you end up with are two groups constantly grappling for power. Neither can abuse its own limited share of power, because their every action is thwarted by the other. If they worked together, the nation would be their oyster -- but their group identities bind them stronger than any law possibly could. The two groups will only be able to accomplish things which both groups agree on -- and those things will be rare and far in between.

The credentials are given to everyone in a public education system. When they take a class, they are being given information on the respective subject. The method of qualification is my argument. When a student doesn't get good grades, they receive a low GPA resulting in a low rank, which shows that they are not qualified to move forward. They might be brilliant in that particular subject but they need to demonstrate it. They do demonstrate it. Say, for example, you are at the top of your Art class. But you fail your History class. Does this show you as brilliant? Not according to the hierarchy of subjects, which puts History far above Art.

CEOs make up an infinitesimal amount of the population. So do Senators and Congressmen. Most influential positions are a very small number of the population. The small number isn't a very good basis for dismissing their importance when we're considering the power, influence and prestige that flows from these positions. That just means it's concentrated, not irrelevant. We're talking about people who effectively 'make the rules,' so that's why we care about representation in business, politics, etc. The bigger question is 'Why are they predominantly male?' It can range from explicit prohibitions (not usually the case today) to institutional ones to self-selecting ones (e.g, are men simply more inclined to pursue these positions?) The right answer, I suspect, is a little bit of institutional, a little bit of self-selecting. To the extent it's self-selecting, we might want to inquire as to why men are more inclined to pursue these positions. If the answer toes a line where women have to spend more time than not dealing with domestic concerns because the familial responsibilities divided down that line, then yeah, we might want to know why it skews that way. Doesn't mean it's wrong; families should be able to divvy up responsibility in whatever way suits them best, but it is worth inquiring. Maybe they made that split because it just seemed implicitly right due to traditional gender assumptions and no one was really thinking about that. But what does that mean for feminists? Presumably some meaningful opportunity for advancement. It's hard to say because 'feminist' isn't a card-carrying party with a platform, so it's reading between the lines based on what some amorphous group of people might think. This opportunity can mean any number of things. My guess is that it's the sort of thing that won't occur until (1) girls are socialized in a way that results in characteristics associated with business and political leaders, including the boldness to pursue those routes; (2) businesses looking kinder upon employees with familial obligations (I think this would be beneficial for both potential fathers and mothers, since family-oriented men are undoubtedly viewed as less hardworking than those who spend more time with the firm), and; (3) all people being raised with the basic understanding that men aren't ipso facto better leaders, and maintaining awareness of the tendency to think this when we start selecting these leaders. I don't think there's a lot of deliberate maliciousness behind this disparity so much as people operating on common assumptions, whether that means a latent belief that this guy is better suited for advancement, but ultimately only because he's a guy. Or that a woman would like to move up the ladder, but she's the person usually on point at home after work, and she opts out because it's too much to balance."}
{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"CMV: Stereotyping, while potentially harmful, is logical as Marketing and Insurance industries depend on it.","output":"First off, I feel like you're making a couple of claims and packaging them as one statement. Because the first claim you make is the fact that we naturally stereotype other people to mitigate risk. You claim that this is natural, and everybody does it. And in this, you are correct. However, your second statement, one that implies that you can market and actively make decisions based on these stereotypes is flawed. Now, before moving forward, I just want to say that I actually worked for these marketing companies that make decisions based off of demographics and location, so I feel like I have an \"insiders\" point of view, and can tell you specifically what is wrong with your way of thinking. Not that I think that you haven't given it thought; it's pretty clear that you've put some time into your argument and I appreciate that! The problem is, by making these decisions off of what is objectively very little information about your demographic, you cut them off to possibilities and create a negative feedback loop for a particular stereotype. For example, in your argument about the convenient store selling grape juice and white T-shirts to black people, ask yourself why is this the case? You see, there is nothing inherently \"black\" about grape juice and white T-shirts. More than anything, it's just culture reinforcing itself and creating circular logic. By the same token, there is nothing \"black\" about being poor. In fact, when pushed, even the most hard-core racist people will tell you they have no problem with people who act like Barack Obama, Will Smith, or Condoleezza Rice. It's those other \"hood blacks\" they don't like. The problem with your marketing analogy is that you're essentially cutting people off from different possibilities and avenues based on a predetermined set of rules \u2013 that actually has no basis. For example, a white person living in \"the hood\" is just as likely to commit crimes and engage in criminal behaviour when subjected to the same variables as a \"stereo typical black person.\" When you say that you are \"statistically mitigating risk\" you are only doing that because this generation's Caucasian great-great-grandfathers had no problem practising open racism. And just so you don't get hung up on the racism thing, let me give you an alternate example so that you understand the larger point: making sweeping behaviors, Marketing choices, and other general assumptions based on one specific characteristic is dangerous. People in the police force literally cannot eat donuts anymore because of the stereotype. Why does it matter, it's just donuts, right? The point is, every time they eat a doughnut, they are conforming to this cartoonish, one dimensional version of themselves \u2013 and people judge them for it. So they don't."}

Time scale problems: As mentioned by another commenter, if opt-in programs facilitated fertility by a large factor, there would still be an impact over time to lower human size. Economic problems: This has come up a couple times. I think the easy answer would be prosthesis (see the gorg commander in the movie Home). Not just that, but children are living in cities just fine, so I don't think this is a strong point. Health: Perhaps the most important consideration.

All that money and expense should be invested in undersea\/space exploration or pure scientific research where it has a much clearer benefit to us all. Yes, in theory we could embark upon a several hundred-several thousand year program to shrink ourselves by half. But, why? That's like saying, we could totally bioengineer real, fire-breathing dragons and release them on Sumatra. We probably could. It would be hugely expensive, but the why still eludes me. I would have to point out that Pomeranians are entirely dependent upon an artificial environment created for them. If you remove humans from the equation then dogs will survive as a species, but probably not the very small breeds.

Two things: First, when you say \"knew\" what you mean is \"strongly suspected.\" Second, that would make you an extremely bad lawyer, and not just bad in a technical sense but in a moral sense, because you would be allowing your personal judgment of someone's moral character to corruptly and maliciously prejudice the court system. If the evidence that the prosecution has is flawed and insufficient to show the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, then it is a lawyer's binding ethical and moral obligation to show that to the jury. Your gut feeling about how pretty sure you are that your client is a bad person is irrelevant.","output":"The question isn't whether it is the foundation of our system, the question is if they should be criticized. There are plenty of things that are legal that are morally wrong. If I can get someone off because the victim is black and I'm able to get one racist onto a jury or I'm able to play to the prejudice of racist jurors, that's morally wrong. If I slut shame a rape victim and that's how I create reasonable doubt, that's morally wrong. Second, that's why I'm not and likely will never be a defense attorney. However, a lot of cases aren't personal judgment, you can often know your client is guilty, he might even tell you. In other cases the evidence is overwhelming. You can know your client was at the scene of the crime, but attack the vision\/memory of prosecutor's witness who saw the defendant there. How in any way does that help to serve the interests of justice? Zero good is done for the world and the world is objectively made a worse place by your pursuing that line of inquiry. All that it does is help a rapist or murderer go free. Jurors are generally stupid. They honestly don't understand half of what they are being told. I've had the opportunity to see mock juries deliberate on cases and it turns my stomach seeing how they arrived at their decisions. Half the people in this country have been convinced that global warming is a liberal conspiracy. A defense attorney manipulating stupid people doesn't serve the interests of justice. There is a difference between someone getting a fair defense, and knowingly manipulating morons to help someone who is guilty, and if released, will likely victimize more people."}

The customer's of good salesmen don't tend to have buyer's remorse like you did. Good salesmen understand the needs of their customers and help ensure that they get the product that will fit their needs the best. I have personally walked away from more deals than I can count in my career because I knew that my solution wasn't in the client's best interest. I care about having customers for life, and that mean caring more about their solution than my commision. Sure, not all of us are like that, but there are bad apples in every barrel. There are some engineers out there that put malicious code in their work, but I'm not going to assume that every engineer is like that. There are some cooks that spit in their food, but I'm not going to assume that every cook is like that. Why is it then fair to assume that every salesman is out to screw you? The information bias could much better be tackled by reducing societal complexity, reducing the need to sort through all the \"options\" capitalism cooks up to sell. There are only options because there are so many different types of problems and so many different preferences that consumers have. As a general rule, consumers create products - products don't create consumers. We have multiple automobile manufacturers and models because the original Model T didn't meet everyone's needs perfectly; a new car was created by a different company which met the needs of a different group of people better and was thus a better product for them. Capitalism encourages companies to compete with each other so as to best satisfy the consumer's needs. The products get better, safer and cheaper - all benefits to you as the buyer. As well as using aggregated system of information like reviews. That does work well, but only when we are dealing with a user base who has an analogous set of needs. If you are buying a toaster, then that is probably a fair assumption to make - most people's toast problem has a common solution. You can then trust those reviews to sell you on why their particular toaster. When the problems get more complex, the solution isn't always clear. You can't trust that you should buy a Prius or a Dell laptop or a pair of Levi 501's just because ProductReviewGuy325 says that they worked for him. You need input on your specific problem from someone who is an expert in the needs that a particular product satisfies. That is where I come in."}

Not entirely a valid comparison. I don't assume every programmer puts malicious code in or every cook spits in their food because there is no personal incentive for them to do so. In a situation like that, of course they will generally act in the best interest of the consumer. In the same vein, I don't assume every salesman is out to screw me. I assume every salesman is out to make a profit, and the more sales they make, the more they profit. In that atmosphere, of course they will not always act in their consumer's best interest--not maliciously, but when all you have is a product, every situation that can be shaped to be solved by that product will be shaped that way. A sale is almost always better for a salesman than no sale, and good intentions or no, that means that customers will sometimes be pressured into buying things they ultimately do not need.

I won't deny that sales can attract sleazy people because there is direct reward for sleaziness, even if it is only fleeting.

Sadly, most people never interact with those salesmen, knowing only those that care about the singular deal at all costs. For what I do, relationships matter.

What do they have to gain or lose by the conflict? Do we currently have troops elsewhere? How is the US economy? What do our allies think?

For instance, being married and having a combined income makes it harder to get government assistance, at the same time having children increases government assistance. Because of this, there has been an incredible rise in single parent households If you think single black women are having children in order to get welfare that's an absolutely ridiculous accusation. I feel like your explanation is the \"welfare queen\" straw man. I don't think very many people like this exist. People Love their children. More than likely they will spend more on a child than the welfare bonus provides. Something to consider about weddings is that unless you get married in the courthouse it costs a good amount of money. Money people in poverty aren't likely to have, especially considering a \"shotgun\" wedding of sorts. You think people in poverty have the money for a wedding and then immediately a kid? With black people disproportionately in poverty this is force against marriage and therefore \"married births\" Another thing to consider is what about unmarried couples raising children together? Is the assumption that unmarried births mean mothers literally living on their own with the child? I don't think that's fair, and I don't think that marriage creates a more legitimate father. As others have said, the war on drugs and disproportionate incarceration rates have taken more fathers away than anything else. I think you may be right in a way. Without welfare a bigger portion of black people would be out of poverty. Not because people actually choose to be on welfare over working, but because some people would literally starve to death. You have to prove the idea that people want to be on welfare instead of working when they have the opportunity. When is comes down to it there are 2 stable possibilities to keep people on welfare. 1. People on welfare want to get off welfare but there are no opportunities to do so 2. People on welfare don't want to get off welfare but there are opportunities to do so.

China with is current territorial holdings has a right to exist, etc\" you can substitute. 2. Legitimate meaning it has the support of the people. Illegitimate governments SHOULD be changed in Some way. That could be an overthrow off the government to a competent new democracy, or changing internal rolls within the existing system. 3. Support meaning the citizens should participate in government and not attempt to violently overthrow it.","output":"Rights are an incredibly nebulous topic that philosophers have been circling about for centuries. According to Hobbes, no one has any rights because we're all in a constant state of warfare. We survive by giving up some freedom for protection. So what are you entitled to? Who entitles you? At the end of the day, no one has any inalienable rights beyond what we've all agreed to. So if you have any rights a country must have rights to exist, because without that country's existence no authority could recognize your rights in the first place. Anarchists claim that we could all just get along, but the first organized group to come in is going to sweep you aside and their rights are immediately going to dominate. What makes a government legitimate? Accurately expressing the will of the people? Again, legitimacy for a government has no real meaning except what we all agree on. In the past, this mostly came down to force. Today, with improved quality of life and enough free time to ask these sort of questions, we factor in representation for whatever reason. But you wouldn't survive long enough to ask these questions if society hadn't evolved over millenia through a history of violence to get where we are today. Was the Roman Empire an illegitimate government? How about the Chinese emperors who ruled for 2000 years? Were the Greek democracies fair who represented landed males? Or how about any of these compared to Ghengis Khan? Today we talk about the right to exist for several reasons. Because we have enough excess time and empathy to concern ourselves with things we would have once ignored. But moreso for international power struggles. If you ever look at geopolitics on a large scale you see things like US support of Israel have little to do with how the president personally feels about Zionism. These views predominate Reddit, but not world politics. At the end of the day, rights and legitimacy are entirely human constructs. If you choose to define them in such a way that you recognize yourself but not your government, be aware that the government may disagree. They have the power to do a lot more about it than you do."}

There's no problem with that, it is natural that human groups would exchange ideas and elements of their cultures willingly. The problem is when a majority culture co-opts a minority culture without A) any due respect (see: Native American Headdresses being used as a fashion statement) or B) a lack of awareness or even disdain for the culture they're appropriation (see: Iggy Azaela and some of her more racially charged statements). It isn't a black and white issue at all, and there are fuzzy lines. We see this come up a lot when it comes to Halloween costumes, and it isn't difficult to see why.

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"In this case the limitation of not having the X-men is barely a ripple compared to the wealth of characters that are available to the MCU show runners. Are these characters that the general public is aware of? It's hard to argue that a few of the XMen aren't some of the biggest Marvel Comics IPs. (Obviously with the rise of the MCU, they are being quickly displaced, but before, Hugh Jackmans Wolverine was widely considered a great choice and made BUTTLOADSAMONEY). The sheer amount of self restraint that the MCU has shown is evidence of this. The re-working of Ultron and the Vision for example. I thought Age of Ultron was a bad movie, fwiw. Ultron was a horribly written and horribly directed bad guy. I fealt nothing for him. Wonder Man, Tigra, Various incarnations of Giant man (not counting Pym), Wasp (although she has some off screen relevance), Black Knight, Moon Knight, Hercules, Captain Marvel, She-hulk, Firebird, Namor, Dr. Strange... I know of Pym and Wasp because they were already in AntMan. I know OF captain marvel, but nothing beyond the name, and the fact that they are sometimes a guy, sometimes a girl. She-hulk I am aware of only because it's a girl version of the hulk (original writing there guys.) Dr. Strange, again, I'm only aware of because I know they are going to do an MCU movie based on it. Maybe I'm holding myself in too much of an average regard, but when I see all this shit that I know nothing about, as someone who doesn't generally read comics, and I'm only being made aware of them through these films.... I don't know. It gets a bit overwhelming. In comics, it's okay to make up ... being frank, outright stupid origin stories. In the movies, they still do stupid shit, but it reflects much more harshly on the film, and on the franchise as a whole, in my opinion. People still complain about the ridiculous inconsistencies in AntMan for example. They didn't complain nearly as much with Iron Man when he used a ruler to make sure the height on his super delicate magic energy devices was level (though people did complain.) That is a bit of a tangent though - if it was one of a handful of people, it wouldn't be a big deal. When it starts to be bucketfuls of badly written crap, it's going to lose a lot of its edge. Mostly because they have such a wealth of characters to pull from even without them. You know, I keep hearing this, but I'm not actually sure I agree with it. Just because you have 30 million bazillion characters, doesn't mean all of them are novel, and especially doesn't mean that all of them are marketable. Perhaps that is a position of ignorance from me, as I read very very very few comics (less than a handful in my life), but when so many of them start to blend together, it is hard to really... \"care\" about a character. Good post though, thank you for making it. :)","output":"Arguably, before the movies the general public was barely aware of any of the characters. They might know the name, and maybe the superpower... but not the core character. Ie they might know Captain America, but have no clue who Steve Rogers was. Comic fans and the \"geek\/nerd\" subculture did... but when the movies started being made they were seen as Niche films that ended up expanding the niche to the point where it's arguably the best acting and character development on the big screen right now. The Self-restraint and work-around involving Ultron\/Vision was in how they were created. There are at least 3 other characters in the comics that had not yet been introduced who are essential to his creation. that could have been 10 minutes that watered him down. You aren't supposed to have empathy towards Ultron as the movie was written, he's just supposed to piss you off and make you want to see him destroyed. That is a bit of a tangent though - if it was one of a handful of people, it wouldn't be a big deal. When it starts to be bucketfuls of badly written crap, it's going to lose a lot of its edge. Bad writing is bad writing. It doesn't matter if it's a 30 second sketch or a 3 hour movie. Having the X characters has no impact on that at all though. (Going back to the original point.) You yourself are stating that you barely know these characters, but how many of the X characters were you aware of before the movies? How many of the X characters are in the movies that you can't name? Just because you have 30 million bazillion characters, doesn't mean all of them are novel, and especially doesn't mean that all of them are marketable. Perhaps that is a position of ignorance from me, as I read very very very few comics (less than a handful in my life), but when so many of them start to blend together, it is hard to really... \"care\" about a character. ahhh.. here's the Crux. You still think that Marvel is using the characters to drive the marketing. They aren't... MARVEL is the name that drives the marketing. They have created such an intricate Universe with so few continuity errors that going to see the next movie is just looking to see what the next puzzle piece is going to be. It's not a self contained experience like an old Arnold flick. The writing is intentionally set to make you go back and re-watch the earlier films to piece together the hidden messages etc. As far as not having enough to grow with... even if they can't find a way to fit a \"squirrel girl\" or whoever into the MCU... the MCU is now creating new main characters on it's own. Phil Coulson is the perfect example. Here's a one off character that ended up driving an entire show. The MCU has a huge catalog to pull from, and as long as the writing doesn't get too hackish on more than 1-2 movies in a row the Marvel name will draw us in. Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Ant Man, Guardians of the Galaxy... these are not names with a draw to most people. but they're outperforming pretty much anything DC can put out on the big screen besides Nolan's trilogy. At least compared to expectation... and definitely when comparing quality. DC does do better small screen, and has consistently for decades. But only with their marquee names. People go to watch Batman, but they go to experience the MCU."}

I doubt anyone in the Reddit HQ was so petty and shortsighted to have fired \/u\/chooter on the spot on a whim, especially considering the impressive amount of responsibility she held in her position. I know reddit likes to bash Pao and the admins, but I have a hard time believing anyone on the staff would be so clueless about this. Really, think about it. All the people you work with, you know the general gyst of what they do in their job, and what their job duties entail. You might not know all the specifics, but you know Earl is an accountant, you know Margaret is in data entry, etc., etc. And you would know a little more intimately if you were in charge of those people, aka in a position from which you can fire them. I really, REALLY doubt that the person who was in charge of Victoria didn't know that she met up with celebrities on a regular basis, and acted as a liaison between the site and the celebrity. Maybe if they were extremely out of touch, they wouldn't know to what extent her importance to the company had, but the people in charge sure would. No one, and I mean no one, would look at Victoria's duties and responsibilities and decide, on a whim, that she would need to be let go, unless they were incredibly stupid and self destructive. And I know how much you all like to basically attribute those qualities to the admins, namely Pao, but I find that hard to be the case. I regrettably have to believe, with the evidence that we have right now, that Victoria performed some kind of gross violation of company policy that resulted in her needing to be immediately terminated, consequences be damned. I do not think that the people who fired her did not understand the gravity of such a decision, and I believe that the violation had to have outweighed, or at least been comparable to the consequences that firing her would bring. Now just for shits and giggles, I'll talk about the Jesse James theory. He couldn't have taken legal action against Reddit for being offended by the internet, period. I don't think he has the kind of clout to demand someone's job, especially for something so asinine and for something that was clearly not her fault. However, one thing that I do find a little bit curious is how quiet the admins have been throughout this whole ordeal, not even making a farewell post for Victoria, to my knowledge. As far as I can theorize, I'd assume that they're stuck in negotiations with the mods on making the subs public again, or they just decided to go into the company bunker to wait for all this to blow over. Either way, I doubt someone fired her without a legitimate reason to do so, and really, I'm going to feel tat way until someone shows me hard, factual evidence otherwise, and not just character statements and testimonials.

There are others, like myself, who disagree. Personally, for me, my pro-choice stance is a combination of both emotion and practicality. Emotionally: I've had two children and two miscarriages. I know the physical and emotional toll that being pregnant can take, and I wouldn't inflict that on anyone against their will. Practically: On top of that, the majority of women who seek abortions are low income and often have inadequate access to prenatal care, which significantly increases the chances that their pregnancy would be actually life-threatening. For example: Women who receive no prenatal care are three to four times more likely to die of pregnancy-related complications than women who do. Those with high-risk pregnancies are 5.3 times more likely to die if they do not receive prenatal care. Healthy People 2010 \u2014 national health objectives developed in 1998 by US federal health agencies \u2014 set a goal of 90% of women receiving \u201cadequate prenatal care\u201d (defined as 13 prenatal visits beginning in the first trimester). However, data suggest that, for 25% of women, their care falls short of this goal. This figure rises to 32% for African American women and 41% for American Indian and Alaska Native women. Abortion is safer than childbirth at any stage, and the earlier the abortion, the safer it is. In short, if you give me a choice between a fetus incapable of surviving outside of the womb (89% of abortions take place before 12 weeks and 99% of abortions take place before 20 weeks; the youngest surviving preemies were born at 21 weeks, 5 days) and a living woman with ties to the world and, in many cases, other children who depend on her (nearly two thirds of women who seek abortions already have at least one child), I'm going to pick the woman every single time, without exception. I'm in the \"safe, legal, and rare\" camp. Western Europe has the lowest abortion rate in the world despite the fact that first trimester abortions are legal and readily available in most Western European countries. This is due to a combination of many factors, including comprehensive sex education, universal health care that makes effective birth control and high quality prenatal care readily available, and more. I'd like to see the US move in that direction and I think if we did, our abortion rate would decline naturally on its own. Given the US's existing state of patchy sex education and improving but still inadequate access to effective birth control, I'm not going to blame someone for seeking an abortion for an unwanted pregnancy that occurred due to birth control failure or similar causes. And frankly, if the person both knew about and had access to effective birth control and was simply too irresponsible to use it, I don't want them within 100 feet of a baby, in the womb or out. :P"}

The government can make sure every has access to healthcare without being \"in charge\" of it per se. As history has shown countless times, government is not the most efficient distributor of goods and services (Soviet Russia, anyone?) The capitalist system we enjoy in the US allows us to work for wages, with which we can buy what we need and provide for ourselves those basic necessities. This system also creates competition and therefore, a variety of brands in everything from shoes, to toothpaste, and even health insurance. Without this free market incentive, we would not enjoy such variety, and we would be forced to rely on whatever goods and services the government sees fit to provide (I hope you like government-flavored toothpaste.) Now, we should keep in mind that some people, for whatever reason, will not be able to afford the basic needs of their livelihood. I think it's a reasonable assertion that government should be in charge of caring for these impoverished individuals and making sure (through welfare, medicaid, public school system, public transportation, etc) that these people are still given access to necessities, and have an adequate standard of living. TL;DR: Just because it's necessary doesn't mean the government has to be the one to provide it. The free market system, combined with a government safety net for those in poverty, is a more efficient way to ensure everyone's basic needs are met."}

Obesity shouldn't be defended or have any concessions made for it because it is a failing in one's personal hygiene. CMV.","output":"Look at this from a societal perspective, not a personal one. In the last few decades the number of overweight and obese people in the U.S., U.K., and Australia has risen dramatically. In order for your view of obesity as a hygiene issue to hold, you must believe that large numbers of people in these three nations just decided to say \"fuck it, I'm just not gonna bother\" and purposely let themselves go, all at once, and have stuck with it for years and years, despite the enormous amounts of ridicule, discomfort and diseases associated with excess weight. If we look at who is obese, we see that it's strongly correlated with wealth\/income. The poorer you are, the more likely you are to be obese. I know a lot of poor people and always have, probably always will. A solid 20% of the U.S. live in poverty today, and another 20% live in near-poverty (only 1 paycheck away from being screwed, basically). Many of them are obese. Why? Calorie dense foods are cheap, available and less time consuming than the alternatives. Most poor people work their asses off all day, every day. Many hold down 2 or 3 jobs sometimes, just to keep their families housed, safe, fed and clothed. Hitting the gym isn't an option for them, and even if it was, they're usually doing more physical work than the majority of gym-goers anyway. The difference is that paid work is repetitive, stressful (in the bad way, most often), and non-negotiable if you want to keep your job. So all their physical work results in bodily damage and stress, leading to health problems and increased cortisol levels (responsible for increased fat sotrage and decreased metabolism in addition to triggering stress eating behaviors). And if you're working multiple jobs like this, you probably don't get much sleep, and when you do it isn't very restful, leading to further weight gain and health problems. As wages stagnate and governments continue austerity measures in the U.S. and other countries, this problem will most likely continue to increase despite vastly increased awareness and education, because the lower income groups continue to be a larger and larger percentage of the population. Not everyone who is obese or overweight falls into these categories, certainly. There have always been fat people throughout history and I doubt that will ever really change. But the vast numbers of people who are currently overweight or obese are part of a medical epidemic with social roots instead of purely biological ones, but those effected can't take an antibiotic to cure it, or avoid sex with infected partners to stay free of it. Being born poor is the single greatest predictor of being poor in adulthood. And being poor is the single greatest predictor for obesity in the Western world."}

Let me start off by saying I'm a circumcised man myself, who frankly didn't give a shit about circumcision until around six months ago when I was exposed to the large body of information on the web that points to circumcision being harmful. First of all, here are five peer reviewed studies I've found which I feel make the case pretty well for circumcision doing more harm than good. Also, I'd like to point to one of the studies you referenced. You'll see that the primary author is Brian Morris. Mr. Morris is not a doctor and there is . I'll let you be the judge of that. You mentioned the WHO recommending circumcision. Here are some statements from dozens of medical organizations in different countries that have taken a stance against circumcision: You'll find that most all medical organizations in Europe are against routine circumcision. Regarding the percentage of people who are circumcised, yes most of the midwest is. But the and continues to drop. If we look at the whole world, In terms of psychological damage, , a personality disorder. While a baby won't remember circumcision, it's said that a baby's blood cortisol levels spike during circumcision and this affects their development. In terms of HIV prevention, In terms of \"satisfaction\", I'll offer an anecdote from an uncircumcised man describing his pleasure, if you'll excuse the graphic detail: When pressed for details, my friends described ejaculation as something that felt good for the penis, and pleasure that lasted for about 5 seconds after a while masturbating with lotion. For me, this experience was (and still is) vastly different. My friends described the sensations of orgasm as something limited to the penis. For me, orgasm was something that not only felt good for my penis, but also felt good for my entire body. Orgasm for me is not some sudden surprise coming, either, but rather something I can feel coming on from the very moment I begin masturbating (or these days, making love). And even when the moment comes, orgasm for me is peak to a gradual and fulfilling crescendo of sexual pleasure, where it reaches an apex after I ride waves of pleasure up and down, and slowlywind down enjoy the aftermath of that feeling. Before reading stuff like this, I was completely content with my penis and probably would have never even guessed it could be better. Everyone will be satisfied with their dick if it's all they know. But now I know there's something better out there that I'm missing out on.

Have them learn something new in class, then give them a totally different assignment about it? Finally, to get a little bit closer to the topic, I'm not necessarily in favor of grouping students into buckets. The practice can help gifted students excel, for example, but it can also put struggling students in with other struggling students, which can have a deleterious effect. If you don't see any of your peers excelling, then it's harder to follow an example. When you put struggling students in a gifted program they can sometimes do better.

I can see how the would be proud of the culture, but it's not like the instant a deaf person gets a cochlear implant, or a child gets one, that they will never learn sign language or interact with deaf people ever again. It seems childish to ostracise someone for wanting to have more opportunity and perception, or to want their child to have more opportunities and less difficulty in life.","output":"What is a cochlear implant? It's a surgical procedure which will take a child out of one cultural group (deaf) and place them in another (non-deaf). Compare that with similar surgical procedures you could imagine: - lightening the skin of a black child to make them appear white - performing a sex change operation on an infant with ambiguous genitals (e.g. changing a boy with a micropenis into a girl) - performing brain surgery on homosexual teenager to make them heterosexual (if such a thing were possible!) Now, you could argue that all of these things would make people's lives \"easier\". It's easier to be the same as the majority (white, \"normal appearing\" genitals, straight). But we'd find all these things morally and ethically reprehensible - in some cases, even if the person was of age and consenting (think Michael Jackson). Does a black person have the right to make themselves white surgically? Sure. Should they do so? Most people would say no, and I think most people can see why if it became a trend, it would harm the black community as a whole. It would treat dark skin as a problem to be fixed, thereby further stigmatizing those who choose not to make the change. Should parents make that choice for their children, or encourage their children to make that choice, or allow them to make that choice before they're 18? I think most people would say emphatically no - even though we know that being black in the US carries significant social stigma and decreases opportunities for financial and professional success. Deafness is perceived as a disability by the non-deaf community, because we can't imagine living without hearing. However, by the deaf community, it's perceived as a culture. Deaf people often live in communities together; they have a shared language; they have a sense of solidarity that comes from being part of a shared culture. Deafness makes certain things harder, as does having dark skin or being gay. BUT it also entitles you to a place in a community of people, and there are social and emotional benefits that go along with that. Deaf people can't hear, but does that mean that a deaf child will necessarily be less happy overall with life than a hearing child? I wouldn't say so. That's why it's not a problem that necessarily needs to be fixed."}

Just because people like to watch western movies doesn't mean the local cultures have disappeared. Exactly the opposite, we see vibrant development in local culture and arts in almost every society.

I think the root of this problem is something that's not exclusive to scientific topics, but science is definitely one area where the effects are very visible. Basically, unless you are a media organization with the clout of the New York Times, traditional reporting is not cost-effective. As you say, there are _disincentives_ for taking the time\/effort\/resources to truly understand a topic, and the very nature of science makes this a particularly large chasm to cross. Especially for online publications, writers are working on quantity-over-quality model, so are just not going to take the time to speak with the handful of people in the world who can explain whatever the news happens to be. And even if they do the reporting, they're increasingly unlikely to have any specific training in how to write about these topics for a general audience. Their editors, as you also said, are even less likely to have the context to catch errors or clarify explanations. That's if they have editors at all. This is all to say that, yes, it's highly unlikely that access to primary literature is going to help the public understand or engage with science. As a PIO, my job is to foster that engagement about new research coming from my faculty.

Domestic Violence is mostly against women, and that is by association, so I'm not sure I agree that most violence is by strangers against males.) 2. \u2206 I definitely agree with you here. Pretty much anything that you do that's sexual or non-sexual leads to some form of discontent. However, I'd like to believe this happens more to women than men. I have no proof or support here, so you've changed my mind. 3. I also didn't take this into mind. (This is my first post here, do I post multiple deltas or just say I agree?) I do know that for the minorities, especially, they are forced into family obligation and work long hours, many times with hard, manual labor. 4. If we're looking at a person-to-person basis, that's individual. I was talking more about society. Advertising, especially. Think: American Apparel? Also, there are plenty of women who get ignored, or don't get approached by the men they want. (aka: lower in the status chain) 5. 6. Until recently? What about 9\/11? We've stopped going against the \"Negroes,\" then we stopped going against the \"Japs,\" so now we're against the \"Jihads.\" They haven't been denied rights (although some airport procedures may question that), but they are heavily oppressed in society. They're looked down upon, people may feel frightened to hire them, and in public places, there is a fear of their customs. 7. But in America, there is more racism against people of color. My mother isn't a lone example. I, and many other Asian-Americans (born and raised here), also receive racism from peers and authorities, starting from pretty early on from teachers and classmates. 8. Source? 9. Whether it was an example of racism or religious intolerance, it still supports my viewpoint. (I simply believe that religion and race are tied together. For example, it's hard to find a white Muslim.) Jews are also a minority, and therefore, it's still supporting my points. Thanks for taking the time in trying to change my mind.","output":"Most violent crimes against men. And there are many male victims of domestic violence. However, I'd like to believe this happens more to women than men. It may or it may not, but it hurts to be bullied whether or not it happens more to women.

I'd imagine you should just post multiple deltas and let deltabot sort it out. I do know that for the minorities, especially, they are forced into family obligation and work long hours, many times with hard, manual labor. Yeah. I know quite a few minority men who essentially have to work all day and get to spend no time with their families. Racism mixed with male obligations means kids don't get to spend much time with their father, which means the kids are more likely to have problems growing up. It's not a good cycle. If we're looking at a person-to-person basis, that's individual. We are all individuals. My knowledge of this comes from experience. I have done cosplay in skimpy outfits (since the characters wear skimpy outfits) and have had women slap my ass or pinch me. It's extremely unpleasant and I'd prefer it wasn't seen as ok for men or women. I was talking more about society. Advertising, especially. Think: American Apparel? Virgin shaming is quite common in advertising too. It's an easy marketing tool. You show how terrible someone's life who hasn't had sex was, then show them how your product changed their life and made them a happy person who had sex. (Look at our new chewing gum. Before this man was a lonely, ugly, shut in and everyone hated him. Now he chews our chewing gum and girls are falling on him. Buy it now.) Also, there are plenty of women who get ignored, or don't get approached by the men they want. And they complain about it a lot as it sucks. It is sad to be completely unwanted. Until recently? What about 9\/11? There's certainly racism in regions, but I was talking more about obvious, state legalized racism- lynching, banning people from public transport, banning them from jobs. America used to do that. Now at least if you do really well for yourself as a minority you can get about safely. Those who don't speak English well, like your mom, have more problems. But in America, there is more racism against people of color. Remember your article about many universities being heavily asian? If you're in a mostly white region, you're more likely to face racism against your race. If a white person (meaning, european white) is in a mostly asian region such as a mostly asian area of town in university they could easily face racism against whites. So we should devote more effort to catching racism against minorities, but white people who face racism could be just as badly hurt. On what the article said. In California, the rise of the Asian campus, of the strict meritocracy, has come at the expense of historically underrepresented blacks and Hispanics. Their main complaint, as they repeatedly said, wasn't that white people were being beat out, it was that black people and hispanics were being beat out. Whether it was an example of racism or religious intolerance, it still supports my viewpoint. Well, you were saying that he attacked the people because he thought they were muslims. He probably just attacked them because he hated everyone who was non white. That does support your point, but it is an important distinction- I wouldn't want a Sikh reading it and then thinking that it would be helpful telling a Neo Nazi that they weren't Muslim. Neo Nazis are generally horrible people and they hate almost everyone."}

First, science class should not only be about teaching facts. While there are certain objectives that students must meet, the purpose of science is not to shove facts down someone's throat. The purpose is to question why. Why do things work the way they do? Why do we believe what we do today? Why are some things better supported than others? Second, to have a valid argument for anything, you need to present multiple sides of the story. If you read any well-written argumentative paper, they present both their side and the opposite side, which they then refute with their evidence. Having an ability to understand and refute other ideas is an essential part of learning scientific thinking. Third, I can guarantee that someone, as in one of the students, will bring it up. And then it creates a teachable moment. You don't want to sweep a student's beliefs under the rug, because then you lose a connection with them, which is important when teaching. Having a lesson already built that can be pulled out when this happens is very, very useful. Last, my goal is to create thinkers. It is much more important to create future citizens who can analyze, understand, and synthesize information. This is much better than throwing facts at them, which may then change 10 years from now. Science is not a static thing, and should not be taught as such. Scientific thinking, on the other hand, is helpful throughout someone's life. Basically, Creationism, or other ideas of the start of man\/the universe, should be used as a vehicle for teaching scientific thinking instead of completely ignored. It is one of the most controversial topics, and therefore will be one of the most passionate and effective tools for accomplishing this. edited to add this: I am not saying it should be a viable scientific theory, or taught as such. Just that ignoring it is not doing justice to those students who believe it. second edit: I don't lead discussions about Creationism. I merely moderate student-led discussions while giving pointed questions and evidence."}

It's definitely a position that is giving me a lot of thought though. Thanks for replying!","output":"Wait. So you're saying there's a difference between the idea of someone changing their mind about someone and someone's attraction to someone changing? I disagree with that. I think attraction to someone is a type of understanding of the person, based on whatever factors are relevant to you. To me, that seems like a type of opinion. I think you could list off the reasons why you are attracted to someone, if you were motivated, and that list could possibly be 100% what makes you attracted to someone, give or take a few superficial bits. I think that you're concluding that a given person shouldn't have to change a potential date's opinion of them, because if the potential date is judging you on factors that you can't or are unwilling to change, then you're going to have trouble down the line anyway, because there's not enough in common for the couple to foster a \"real\" attraction. Couple things: 1) Changing someone's opinion of you might just be a matter of introducing factors that positively affect their view of you. It might just be a matter of getting to know each other better. 2) I doubt that the relevant factors for every potential date are going to be unchangeable for every person they're willing to date. Maybe you'd be willing to change some things about yourself that will make you more attractive (discounting superficial factors that wouldn't provide a real, loving compatibility). That might be a waste of time for you, but hey, whatever floats your boat might sink mine. 3) I get the idea that you think there are basic, ineffable factors that just must be fulfilled for a real attraction to ever surface between a couple, and that these factors can't be changed, probably because they're some sort of essential characteristics that are tied deeply to who you really, really are. I can't really challenge you on this point, because it'll come down to two things: whether you think people can change (or, if enough of them can change to make them attractive to someone who wasn't attracted to them previously) and whether you think attraction is a determinable thing. I'm a yes on both points, for the record. My final opinion is that the possibility for attraction can exist where attraction itself doesn't, and sometimes it can take a little finagling to bring that possibility to realization. I don't think anyone can say that's not worth the trouble every time."}

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"People cheering on Bitcoin's \"success\" don't understand how currency works. CMV","output":"Currency is meant to be a medium of exchange-- not an investment. Ideally, it should lose value at a slow and steady rate so as to discourage people from holding on to it for too long. When currency gains value, it encourages people to hoard their currency, which is terrible for the economy. As an economics student, everything you say here has been verified by what I have learned. I have no intention of disagreeing with you here. However, I believe that, at this point in time, the hyper-deflation of BTC we have seen over the last year is a very good sign. We know that the supply of BTC is relatively fixed - and this is completely intentional. The global supply of BTC is computer generated - not printed by a sovereign mint. If the supply was not fixed there would be nobody to control it. The entire purpose of BTC is to experiment with a completely non-sovereign currency; that is a currency which is not tied to any one state which exerts monetary and fiscal policy to control or guide the currency. Following this understanding, the only two reasons BTC should be deflating. The first is due to speculation of future returns (i.e. looking at BTC as an investment opportunity, not a currency) which is not ideal for a currency but already occurs with most of the major national currencies which already exist (plenty of examples if you search for US dollar speculation or Euro speculation). The second is because there is an increasing demand for BTC to use as a currency. Both situations represent increases in demand for a product (I know this isn't the correct term but it is helpful to frame it in this way) with a fixed supply, which results in an increase in the product's value. But the second situation - that is, more people want to buy BTC to use it for currency - is fantastic. This means that more people globally are buying into the concept of BTC as a valid means of exchange and they are willing to sell their own currency to do so (buy buying BTC they are selling $US for example). The entire concept of Bitcoin has only been around for 6 years. It is only to be expected that the relative volatility of this currency will be high as it is phased into more widespread use. But at this point, hyper-deflation is a sign that more and more people are beginning to accept BTC as a viable alternative to their country's currency. The expectation being that as more businesses begin to accept payment in the form of BTC there will be downward pressure on BTC as it circulates through the monetary system faster. By no means does this hyper-deflation signal that a central banker should seize control of the supply of BTC and attempt to regulate it. Bitcoin was theorized and designed to be a decentralized currency. To now install some form of central governing authority for Bitcoin would undermine the entire point of the Bitcoin \"experiment\" so to speak."}

This would be a question of fact for the jury to decide. So how is it even possible to regulate anything if proving violating the regulation requires proving that a \"reasonable person\" would know and also that they person did not know? The standard of knowing violation is used all the time in the law. The government routinely has to prove what people knew in order to prosecute them for a crime. How, too, is it even possible to have a standard about whether a reasonable person in a similar position knows about a regulation? Is a poll required of all people in similar positions to the violator? How do you qualify \"similar position\"? The jury isn't going to be people in a similar position to the offender. So how will they know? If the prosecution brings in 10 stock brokers who all testify that they knew about the regulation, does that prove that a \"reasonable stockbroker\" knows about the regulation?

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"CMV: I believe the Gender Pay Gap is Grossly Misstated and Misleading","output":"This whole phenomena has many levels, each one has a minuscule effect but at the end of day they add up. First the obvious: Depending on which study you look 6%-12% of the wage gap you cannot explain away by the more obvious factors like profession, choice, working ours etc. One definitive factor in this number is that women who apply for a typical male job are seen on average as significantly less competent as their male counterparts, even if they have the exact same qualifications, which has been And considering that your received competence is a huge factor when it comes to getting the job and negotiating your salary it will of course impact your income. A similar thing happens by the way if a man applies for a typical female job, which could explain why in some rare branches the pay-gap is almost reversed. But men are less likely to work in a typical female job and those are also anyways less paid, so the effect on the overall gap in the other direction is tiny. Basically as soon as you leave your gender domain people will be critical of you. Kinda like if a electrician suddenly applies as a plumber, he can show all necessary qualifications and experience, but still they would be more critical of him than if a plumber applies for a job as a plumber. This rarely has the form of a conscious belief but lingers in basically all of us as a subconscious bias. And there you can see why the typical counterargument \"If women would really payed less companies would hire them more to save money\" fails, you would not hire someone who you perceive as less competent. Another factor is that women tend to be more risk averse. They are less likely to negotiate their wage and less likely to ask for a promotion. Basically women tend to play save, while men tend to prefer the boom or bust approach. This could be actually a bit influenced by biology, since . On the other hand its also hard to dismiss the way women are taught from an very early age on to be more careful, more polite, more accommodating, more gently, in short more passive than boys. Now we can talk about the more subtle \"choice\" part. Most women, just like most men don't even come to the idea to seriously consider working in an field that is heavily associated with the other gender. Boys who want to become a nurse are as rare as girls who want to become construction worker. Gladly this changes slowly, but gender roles are deeply ingrained in our society and affect what type of choices we \"choose\" to consider. The result is that most women end up working mainly in female jobs and men in male jobs. And it shouldn't take you long to realize that the most typical male jobs are better paid, sometimes quite frankly for good reasons (e.g. more dangerous). This shifts the statistic quite a bit. Another far less discussed way gender roles affect job choices is the provider role of men. Most men have the role of the main (or even whole) breadwinner hammered in their heads or at least accepted it more or less voluntary. This skews the statistic further because then men start to focus more on sole income than other factors and men start to flock towards the best paying jobs, because in back of their heads that whole provider thing is still ticking. Like you mentioned, women on the other hand tend to value other benefits, like better working hours, family friendliness of the company, childcare, maternity leave, etc more out of various reasons. The biggest reason is simply that women still do the vast majority of day to day house work even if both partners are working full time. Same goes for childcare if for example a child gets sick its typically the mother who takes them to the doc, something in school? Again the mother takes care of it. Most men still don't even consider to take maternity leave even if they have the possibility to. As to why this is I suggest you to read . Basically according to typical gender roles men are responsible for the big decisions, while women are expected to handle the small everyday decisions. The problem is that there are only 24 hours in a day and somewhere you have to make room for all those small stuff. Besides that if affects their ability to compete with men, guess who gets the promotion, the guy who works extra hours or the mom who has to leave as soon as possible to pick up the kids? I could list probably more stuff, but I think I wrote already enough. Overall, while the gender pay gap is a problem in itself, its much more a indicator (or symptom if you like to call it that way) of some much deeper lying problems."}

That car may never get 50 mpg but it is understood the rating is for rough comparison to another vehicle. Saying \"50 mpg\" and \"20 mpg\" are \"wrong\" misses the point that they were never predictions. Their goal is to make it clear that the first car is almost certainly more fuel efficient than the second. The same is true with climate models. Calling them \"wrong\" because they do not reflect all the nuances of climate misses the fact that they were never predictions. They are simplified calculations useful for comparison. Multiple runs allow you to do rough outcomes between different conditions. Just as buying a 50 mpg car over a 20 mpg car does not guarantee you 1.5x the fuel efficiency, climate models saying the temperature will rise 2 degrees C by 2050 is no guarantee of that outcome. However, it is still foolish to believe that the 20 mpg car is as efficient as the 50 mpg one or that the 2050 temperature will be the same as it is today."}

Or, if not the same way, to the same degree. Or, if not to the same degree, with the same kinds of results. That where this idea goes off the rails. Let's assume, as with most things, people fall on a bell curve. Most people live in the middle, with some people being extremes on either end. You are 100% correct that for certain jobs and ambitions, you have to be on the exceptional end of the bell curve: model, CIA agent, CEO, NFL player, etc. And, since we're not really talking about it, we'll ignore the other end wherein people are unusually deficient in a particular skill. No, maybe you're not super smart. Or athletic, charismatic, good at the trumpet, or phenomenal in bed. That's okay, that's expected, most people are right in the neat middle of the bell curve. Or, rather, it SHOULD be okay. The problem with beauty is not that the bell curve doesn't apply, it is the business scheme underwriting it that exploits the bell curve. Yeah, I'm not a super model, never will be, that's fine. I am still attractive enough. But there are certain needs that everyone has to meet. First are food, shelter, sustenance. You have to survive. Then comes safety (no use worrying about your existential crisis if you're being chased by a lion). But then comes love. Belonging. Feeling included, appreciated, desirable. We all have this need, we all feel it with a biological imperative to complete it and be successful. And that makes us weak. It makes us vulnerable. The genius thing the beauty industry has done (fashion, skin care, cosmetics, hair products, etc. etc.) is use the outliers on the bell curve to distort the middle. It does this for men and women, no one gets away from this. But not JUST the outliers. Even extremely beautiful women are photo-shopped into unattainable images of perfection. By keying into that universal need, to be wanted, they create a huge market demand for a way, any way, to get that need met. The further you get from the middle, the more exaggerated and unattainable \"pretty\" becomes, the more products you sell. I mean, this is basic common sense. So models move further and further towards the most extreme end of the bell curve because those are the people who will sell the most diamonds, skin cream, and boots. The further you feel from perfect, the more you'll spend to raise your position. This market doesn't exist (to the same extent) for other extremes. Yeah, you can't be an idiot, but there's a wide range of acceptable intelligence and not a lot of money to be made in exploiting it. We encourage sports, but few people expect they'll go pro. There's money to be made there, don't be fooled (Nike, Gatorade, Adidas, REI, pick your thing) but not NEARLY as much because athletic prowess doesn't have the same imperative behind it that being loved does. The reason the beauty industry is so harmful is because it makes its money by making you feel artificially ugly and unfit. And it works so well because it taps into one of our most fundamental and biologically ingrained desires to do that."}

Would you consider the foundations of logic to be an object of faith?

There is a difference between saying that we must assume that solipsism is invalid for all practical purposes and saying that we believe that the world exists as we see it. If we don't constantly offer the caveat that we might be brains in pans within our internal dialogue, we are indulging in faith. So in a certain sense, I would agree that logic is based on faith. We have faith that the cause-effect relationships we see are constant and reflective of the truth; that 2+2 will always equal 4. Every method we have of determining truth is essentially descriptive of what we see, not prescriptive of what must be. Saying that a religion is self-contradictory or contains anything testable is problematic because it treats that religion as a homogeneous entity. There is a broad range of belief within every religion I'm aware of, so treating them in wide swaths virtually guarantees that mistakes born of generalization will occur. I'm curious as to what contradictions you're referring to; both in religions and especially those you believe that are inherent in the idea of God."}

He denied this saying they only talked, and when he saw the camera footage he just stared blankly at me saying \"that can't be me!\" and he was being so honest, yet he was lying. I know a few cases where the accusation was made only as a vendetta, and this has come out afterwards, but these are not only a minority but quite easy to detect.

The last part, however, that change needs to happen urgently kind of implies a sense of immediacy on which I disagree. I just finished pharmacy school and I've done journal club upon journal club during my training. Most clinicians who care are people who can easily pick up on post-hoc analysis, statistics games, and faulty design. The reality is you're never going to have a perfect study design. Also, any clinician worth their salt can tell if the right outcomes are being measured or if they are looking at a (patient oriented evidence that matters). Given that, it's not like the studies that are crap are fooling anyone except maybe laypeople who can get behind paywalls. Also, it's not as if there's consensus on what is best study design or what is the best outcome to measure depending on what the study is trying to accomplish. Now none of this is meant to imply that I think every clinician or the medical community is infallible because of course not but I will point out that clinical consensus is often made with very measured and careful reflection based on the evidence. As such, pushing forward a set of standards without the same careful and measured reflections is kind of counter productive.

C is, in my opinion, the most important part. That \"listen and believe\" was only a poor slogan in its readiness to be manipulated. The actual idea behind \"listen and believe\" isn't that a judge and jury should stop the trail at \"he raped me\"; it's that when a friend comes to you personally about an experience, it's best that, in that moment, you simply (at the very least act as though you) believe the speaker, and listen to what they say. I see this as a sort of extension of Blackstone's Formulation; just as it's better that ten guilty persons go free than one suffer, it's better that you lend kindness to ten liars than show callousness to one victim. \"Listen and believe\" isn't about courtrooms (and anyone that says it is is either lying or has been misled); it's about kindness.","output":"I was thinking of a specific example: Where I live, in Canada, there was a recent scandal involving accusations of sexual assault against a TV host Jian Ghomeshi.

I happen to also be intelligent, responsible, and mature beyond my years because when someone tells you at age four that every choice you make in life will affect your ability to live well, you grow up quickly. [This is going somewhere; stick with me] I met a man while in college who knew from day one about this disabling condition. When my insulin pump was ripped out because I caught it on the door handle, he gave me a foot massage while I re-inserted a new tube. When my body began to resist the insulin I was taking, he made me a bed on his couch, kept my water bottle full, and made me an appointment with my doctor to get a new prescription. He tells me jokes while I change my pump to distract me from the pain. He has taken on my health-conscious diet and exercise plan to encourage me to remain healthy and live as long as I can. I found out when I was eighteen that I will live until I am thirty five at the most. Due to diabetes not being an epidemic in 1990 like it has become, as my pancreas was dying, the doctors did not reach the correct diagnosis; diabetes simply wasn't that common. My organs are shot, my body already resists one of two types of approved insulin, and every day is a process of checking my sugar, eating based on my numbers, exercising based on my numbers, existing based on what my blood tells me I have to do. This man who I have fallen madly in love with has sat by my bed when a common cold has caused my blood sugars to sky rocket and my body to be zapped of energy. When I get high and irritable, he listens and waits until my sugar balances and hugs the anger out of me. On days that I despair because what's the point in living a painful life that will end in a decade anyway, the days I just don't want to change my pump because it hurts and I'm tired of the pain, he reminds me how much he loves me and wants me to live as long as possible. He offers hugs and jokes and massages and water. He gives me foot massages at night because diabetics have terrible circulation, and massages help keep my feet warm. He knows I will be gone too soon, and last January he asked me to spend the rest of my life as his wife. Don't get me wrong, our lives are not horrible. The sex is amazing, the conversations are amazing, we love every moment we spend together. I have never connected with someone the way I've connect with my fiance. We sit for hours in a coffee shop reading books and comics together and then we sit for more hours talking about them. We read philosophical essays and ponder the big questions together. We play with my nieces because we won't ever have a little one of our own. We enjoy each moment together. I wish you could spend a day with us so you could see that in fact, true love does exist. It's real and it's tangible and it's the best experience I've had in life because it's an every day, every night, every I love you, every choice of salad over spaghetti, every understanding that each moment is precious type of feeling. Don't give up on humanity just because those around you don't have love. If every person allowed the opinions and lifestyles of other people to determine his fate, we would have no true love indeed because if I constantly compare myself to others, I will always fall short by being different. How awesome to find the man who I can identify with on such an intense level. And how did I do that? I decided to stop letting everyone else tell me it's not real. I stopped listening to the 'you can't fall in love because you are disable and won't live a full life.' I stayed interested in philosophy and comics and graphic novels and coffee and dancing and biking and just being me. Then I found the love of my life. I know it's easy to accept Tim Minchin's view on true love. But I've traveled to many countries and have never found a person like my man. I don't necessarily believe that I couldn't have been happy with someone else, but I do believe that there are experiences I have had and emotions I have felt that no one else could have procured in me.

I think that one of the many flaws in the US Adult Penal system is that it can't decide whether its goal should be rehabilitation or punishment (or at least to which degree each measure should be considered). From what I recall, Scandinavia is much more unambiguously in favor of rehab. Part of the problem is that, in general, the US has much weaker social programs, and so it's easy to ask the question \"why should convicts have free access to education when non- convicts have to pay?\". Now, we don't say either: 1. Because it costs less to make them productive citizens by giving them skills instead of leaving them in the same circumstances that lead them to commit a crime in the first place and having to lock them up again or 2. You're right- we should pay for everyone to get an education because it benefits all of us. Instead, we say, \"Good point. Let's cut funding for education.\" We could no doubt do a much better job in the rehabilitation side and get many more people to change their lives for the better. But, again, when used properly, the charging of a juvenile as an adult should be for the ghastliest of crimes where the perpetrator has forfeited their right to ever be free in my opinion."}

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"I agree that the environment can determine the mindset. I don't think it's so much that people like their conditions as that they don't know better conditions. Someone in Africa might be used to walking miles to get water for the day, but if you give them the chance of indoor plumbing, I would bet that the majority would happily take it. Of course there are things that are objectively better than others. I don't think the bells and whistles and new colors on a cell phone are it. I don't know about iPhones, since I dislike Apple, but the difference between the first smartphone and modern phones actually IS dramatic. Even the difference between the first and last Samsung Galaxies is, if you actually use the phone as it was intended to be used (i.e. more than just calling and texting). My mom would agree with you - she always says that she doesn't need a newer phone\/pc\/whatever, since the old one works just fine. Then when her old piece dies and she does get a new one, she does admit that the difference is quite noticeable and wouldn't go back. Every time. I do everything on my cell phone. I'm on it right now. I watch Netflix, play games, write e-mails, everything. But at the end of the day it is just mindless entertainment. The things that are actually important that I do on my current newish phone are the same as what I did on my first smart phone. It's interesting in a way - I actually know quite a few people that think upgrading tech gadgets every year or two is useless, but they replace their car every few years, even though there is much less of a difference between a car from the '50 and a modern car than between a phone from even 5 years ago and now. Well yeah. Cars are the worst with planned obsolescence. They release new models every year. That's just ridiculous for a purchase people should really only be making once a decade barring huge life changes like marriage and children. They keep coming out with new models to get people to constantly replace perfectly functional cars with new ones. About socialism in Yugoslavia - depends on who you talk to. There are many so called Yugonostalgics, who would give a kidney to go back. OTOH there are many who remember the not-so-shiny elements of that part of history, who would never trade the current situation, recession or not, for the illusion of wealth in Yugoslavia, which was mainly supported by state-imposed monopolies, isolationism, and the milking of both the West and East Blocs for loans so Yugoslavia didn't side with the other. I'm guessing the nostalgics lived better under socialism and the non-nostalgics live better now even with the recession. That's common. If I was a feudal lord I might have hated the advent of capitalism. If I was a peasant I would love it. If you're the owner of capital socialism sucks for you. The abolition of slavery sucked for the slave owners. It is true, though, that it would be difficult to predict what socialism would look like today. Personally I think it would fail even more spectacularly than in the past, but that's just my opinion. I support socially conscientious capitalism wholeheartedly, and I do believe that every state should mandate that a part of the profits (after taxes) go for the improvement of everyone's lives, but workers getting a say in how a company should be run - no way. There's a reason why professional specializations exist, and letting a production worker dictate marketing instead of a marketing specialist isn't really what would work, I think. Do you diagnose yourself when you're sick or do you go to the doctor? I'll assume you go to the doctor. When the doctor does his diagnosis do you listen to him? Does that make him your boss? Does he have to be your boss for you to listen to him? What makes you think workers are less capable of hiring a marketing specialist than a capitalist?","output":"Of course there are things that are objectively better than others.

The things that are actually important that I do on my current newish phone are the same as what I did on my first smart phone. \"Important\" is subjective. For me, my \"fun\" is more important than my work, because I can more easily find a new job than something new that would entertain me (from stupid games to android programming for example). I'm guessing the nostalgics lived better under socialism and the non-nostalgics live better now even with the recession. Actually, not necessarily (I mean specifically for Yugoslavia now). Many people agree that work (and life in general) was much easier in socialism, and they had more money, relatively speaking, but they wouldn't go back because of how that system suffocated personal productivity, freedom and exceptionalism. OTOH, many &lt;30 y\/o, well-off kids of relatively well-off parents are the strongest supporters for socialism. The generation that doesn't personally remember it has somehow romanticized it beyond all proportion by now. Anecdotally, I'd say that people over 65 and below 30 support socialism. Those in between are mostly for capitalism. That's the feeling I get anyway. What makes you think workers are less capable of hiring a marketing specialist than a capitalist? The fact that they wouldn't, because \"those people just charge too much and don't do anything anyway\", just like 90 % of other white collar workers. I take it you live in the States. Perhaps it's different there, but here, the general consensus among the \"working class\" seems to be that most of the white collar workers are just leeching off their work, not doing anything productive and not contributing at all. A specific example would be that everybody is convinced doctors are overpaid (hint: the average doctor likely makes in the vicinity of \u20ac2000 a month here, which is twice the average salary). As said, I support some socialist elements. I support THEORETICAL socialism and communism. I just don't believe that it can work in real life with the people that inhabit the planet right now.

Of course we do, don't be silly. The confusion comes when we try to apply these very basic gender traits in a world where hunting\/surviving is hardly necessary. We have thousands and thousands of years of evolution telling our bodies one thing, modern society tells us another.

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"Who exactly would be writing these textbooks? Without a copyright, textbook writers wouldn't be able to stop people from just taking their work. There are plenty of people and companies who provide very well researched work and information for free. In a world without copyright, this type of thing becomes more common in efforts to sell non-copyable extras. It also opens up and removes the lock on prices that textbooks have right now. The only reason why textbook makers can charge so much for textbooks is because of copyright. If the information\/examples\/practice problems become widely available due to free sources that schools choose, students would save hundreds of dollars every semester each. As for contributing to a wiki or some such, anyone with enough knowledge to make a meaningful contribution would, presumably, be under an NDA and\/or it would be detrimental to their own livelihood to disclose their employer's secrets. If this were true, why does open source code exist? Why do so many companies create so much free to use content even in our world with copyright? This assumption is a faulty one. There's no reason to believe this would be the case. In a world without copyright and patents, the general mode of business would be extremely different than it is now. Remember that tons of trade, knowledge trading, and contributions were made to the world long before the existence of IP protections. Company A has to price the drug to include the research and development costs while company B can charge less because it doesn't have that associated cost. Company B still needs to take time to reverse engineer the drug, and spend money and time to test it with regulations. The result of this is that instead of the pharmaceutical business model being one that surrounds patenting drugs and selling the same one for over a decade, tweaking it for a new use case, rinse and repeat, the business model would revolve around being first to market with a high price to recoup if the demand exists, then dropping it down once competition arrives. The result of a world without copyright and patents is more innovation because the only way to keep making money is to keep being first to market and profiting until someone can reverse engineer it and compete. This also increases competition and reduces prices for consumers. Games would be relegated to the small and indie with very few exceptions. Small\/indie games are great, but I for one would really lament the passing of major games. Games would still get developed with big budgets, they would just monetize in different ways. If you create a big budget game, the only thing that copyright is preventing right now is someone just taking your code and assets and simply reselling it as their own by copying the disk and producing their own. Copyright doesn't cover game mechanics. If we eliminate copyright, we'd simply see more copy protections\/obfuscation. We're already seeing a huge number of games being primarily multiplayer, which means that attempting to copy the game means you need your own servers and proprietary server software etc. So a lack of copyright wouldn't actually result in a lack of big budget games.","output":"In a world without copyright, [very well researched work and information for free] becomes more common in efforts to sell non-copyable extras.

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"Breeders in big shows like Crufts seem to overwhelmingly breed for looks. You say they're bred for function, but they're not. These aren't working dogs, these are show dogs. Just look at the difference between show german shepherds and police german shepherds (actual working dogs) and you can clearly see that the show german shepherds are bred for their looks (in accordance with the Kennel Club's standards) not for function and their health suffers for it. The 2003 Cruft's champion, a Pekingese, had to sit on an ice pack to have it's photo taken because it couldn't breathe properly due to it's flattened face. The same breathing problems affects pugs and bulldogs. I know you address that there are problems within breeds and that there are other breeds who do fine, but surely the type of inbreeding to this extent that is practised within top dog shows is more than what is considered acceptable. Again, you say there's a balance, and that's probably true, but I'm not sure how well top breeders at dogs shows actually conform to that practice. There's a reason inbreeding amongst humans is illegal; it has severe health consequences. I don't see why dogs, who have no say in the matter, should be treated any differently. I'm not really sure I understand you when you say by not breeding closely enough you will lose the breed type. Sure breeding two unrelated german shepherds still results in a german shepherd. In no way is 'inbreeding to maintain the breed type' a convincing argument. There are tens of thousands of german shepherds in the world. Ultimately, to compromise dogs health for the sake of their looks is greedy and vain and these shows not only allow for this to happen (no genetic testing is required by the Kennel Club with the exception of the Irish Setter), but reward it. Now obviously I don't mean to say that all breeders inbreed their dogs to the point of severe health complications, but there is clearly a problem within the dog breeding community that needs to be addressed either through stricter pedigrees (which disallow grandfather-grandaughter breeding) or mandatory genetic testing.","output":"Sure breeding two unrelated german shepherds still results in a german shepherd. In no way is 'inbreeding to maintain the breed type' a convincing argument. Your thinking seems to be that all dogs of a given breed should already be closely related enough for any random mating to produce quality offspring. Unfortunately, that is not remotely the case in reality. Sure, breeding any two random registered German Shepherds will produce a litter of registerable German Shepherd puppies. But are they any good? If the answer was always yes, there would be no need for breeders, or dog shows for that matter. Yet the best breeders spend hundreds or thousands of dollars (and a bunch of their time and effort) finishing their dogs' championships before breeding them. They obviously consider it of some benefit. There's not actually an argument to be had here. Breeding closely related dogs is how you get stronger breed type. Therefore, logically, if you don't breed closely related dogs, you get weaker breed type. It's not my personal opinion, it's not a myth, it's not something that requires justification, it's how breeding animals works. Imagine if you bred random dogs without regard even for their breed; over enough time, obviously, you would trend toward an \"average\" dog. The same is true (to a smaller extent) within a breed. If you breed random GSDs you eventually end up with average GSDs. And no decent breeder wants to breed merely average dogs! (I'm leaving aside the very real problems in GSDs and other breeds. In truth, it is entirely possible that breeding random GSDs could produce better dogs than many current champions, since there are so many problems with them. They are a bad example for the general case. Remember, there are 180+ breeds recognized by the AKC alone; the number of different breeds recognized by kennel clubs worldwide exceeds 300. Things can be very different from one breed to the next and one country to the next.) Now, how closely related two dogs in a breeding should be is a tradeoff between how much risk you want to take and how quickly you want to progress toward your idea of perfection. This is something breeders debate endlessly. As I said in my first post, a common approach is to outcross (i.e., do a breeding between two distantly related lines) to get some trait you want in your line. (This can also help the health of your line and sometimes you'll outcross just for that.) And then follow this up with a couple of generations of closer breeding to shore up breed type. There is a reason this is a common practice: it works! Some breeders try to avoid any single breeding that is too close (using the coefficient of inbreeding) and others try to keep the average COI over several generations to a safe value. Genetic testing is a great idea and breeders are doing more and more of that. In our breed, we have a blood test for progressive retinal atrophy, a form of blindness with an onset around age 5-6. In the past, this was extremely problematic because breeding usually begins well before that age, making it easy to pass on the trait. With the blood test, we can avoid breeding affected dogs entirely, and gradually reduce even the number of carriers over time until the defective gene is entirely eliminated. (Breeding only clear to clear dogs would eliminate the effective gene immediately, but it would also require us to rule out half our gene pool because they carried the gene even though they did not develop the disease, and were of otherwise of merit. As a rare breed our gene pool is not so large we can afford to do that.) The national breed club requires this testing as a part of its code of ethics. Unfortunately something like hip dysplasia is controlled by many genes as well as other variables, and there is not a genetic test for it. We were lucky with the PRA because it is controlled by a single gene, and that gene happened to be in the first site the research team investigated, in a location analogous to a similar problem in humans. If they had had to do too much hunting, we probably wouldn't have the test. The AKC (or any other national kennel club) will never put into force any kind of registration requirement involving the closeness of breeding. Kennel clubs exist to serve the needs of breeders and, since close breeding is a useful tool in the breeder's kit, breeders would never want such a restriction on registration. For this to happen, you would have to convince a majority of breeders, against hundreds of years of evidence, that close breeding is always a useless or detrimental practice."}

A baby is a baby but a 20-year-old is a more specialized human being that many people have put effort towards and is just starting a career.

Now I don't believe the \"war on terror\" is legitimate, but since it is what is, we have to frame our judgments in light of it. Our government treats these conflicts as being at war, so I guess we have to decide if this working background affects this scenario. First, I would ask how it would have been treated if a U.S. citizen had defected to Germany in WWII, and was fighting against us on the side of the Axis powers. Would killing this U.S. citizen have been murder, and should the President be impeached if he ordered this individual killed in a strike against Germany? I would assume probably not. So if the government considers its current state to be one of war, would we expect defectors to the other side in this case to be treated any differently than they would have been in WWII? If Obama is acting under a state of war, I'm not sure that killing people on the other side is in itself problematic. I think the real problem is that they are involved in most of these engagements and treating them as a war in the first place. As long as they are permitted to continue the \"war\" though, then I'm not sure if these particular events within the \"war\" can really be objected to."}

Intended humorously or not that is different from saying \"I am not attracted to black people\". That said, people do get sensitive around that kind of thing, but I think there are good reasons. Why do you need to say it? Are you absolutely sure that it is purely a natural physical attraction and not tied up subconsciously with the racist garbage common in society? Are you seriously lumping all black people together and saying you don't find any of them attractive? Other than being black (given a very broad definition of black) what exactly are the physical characteristics black people have in common? Even if it is just a physical characteristic, it is a physical characteristic with an intensely political past and present, do you seriously think it is analogous to \"blonde\" vs \"brunette\" or \"curvy\" vs \"skinny\"? Not everyone who has a preference towards white people is racist, probably not even most.

More than that even, it's part of an effort to put as onerous a regulatory burden on guns as possible in an effort to stop there being as many guns out there. If you think guns should be severely curtailed or banned, this strategy could make some sense, especially in the context where the US 2nd amendment prohibits more direct gun control such as is used in Canada. If you don't want to curtail or ban most guns, then this policy probably isn't for you. The point of it though is to make it so fewer people carry guns.

It was a joke. people don't like jokes here it would seem :)","output":"I mean, you don't like him but you've made the point you don't like anyone here. Which is the situation that a lot of people are in right now. Your question seems to be about the general election, rather than the primary, so let's skip over the primary. All the following approval ratings in this paragraph are from . President Obama's ratings are currently: 46% Favorable, 48% Unfavorable, so he has a net favorability rating of -2. That's amazingly probably enough to get an incumbent reelected (if he were able to stand for a third term) and reflects how polarized this country--about half the country (40-50%) will always hate you if they know anything about you. Now, let's compare that sickly number to the two leading candidates: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Hillary is at 40% Favorable, 54% Unfavorable, or -14%. That's not good. But somehow, Donald Trump's numbers are somehow even worse! He's got 35% Favorable, 59% Unfavorable, or an astonishing -24% unfavorable rating. Now, likely, both candidates favorability will improve somewhat should they be selected their parties candidate, as people rally behind them, but these are just monster deficits. These candidates have strong bases of support, but are also hugely unpopular. Just as a comparison, in mid-May 2012 (we're not quite there yet, but let's say), . So not only were Romney and Obama doing better than both candidates, there were far more people who hadn't made up their minds about Romney than Trump--Romney peaked at about 50% Favorable, 44% Unfavorable in the that November. In early March, when the contest was still going on Santorum and Gingrich still presented quasi-viable \"true Conservative\" alternatives to moderate Romney, Romney's Favorable numbers were lower and Unfavorable numbers were higher, but everyone knew that the party and the voters would rally behind Romney. There was no #NeverRomney hashtag, the National Review wasn't writing cover stories about \"Against Romney\". Hilary doesn't quite have as negatives as Trump, but it's not exaggeration that she's more hated among Republican voter before taking office than any other Democrat in the past thirty years. So, in short, no one thinks Trump or Cruz or Hilary is going to grow like Romney did. Now, Rubio could follow a similar path--he's about neutral right now, with a lot of people not expressing a favorable or unfavorable opinion on him (unlike Trump and Hilary, who everyone has an opinion on). And likewise, Sanders actually has a positive net favorability right now. But neither of those candidates are particularly likely to be their party's nominee. Sanders is all but mathematically eliminated, and Rubio is a distant third in the Republican delegate count, with his \"most likely\" path to nomination being a contested convention--something that hasn't happened really since the modern primary era. Which is to say, it seems like it's going to come down to two unpopular candidates. Political scientists are actually sort of excited about this--if it's Trump and Hilary, this will be the first time two deeply unpopular candidates have faced off against each other. Political scientists want to see how hate-voting mobilizes constituencies to the poll--they actually expect a very strong turnout this year. So if you're asking yourself \"Which one do I like more?\", you're asking yourself the wrong question--sadly, in this cycle, the question you should be asking yourself is, \"Which one do I hate more?\" You say, \"I want to make an informed decision and waste my useless vote on someone who will at least not destroy the things I hold dear.\" So--assuming you choose not to vote third party--inform your decision by asking yourself, \"Which candidate is likely to destroy more things I hold dear?\" and then vote against that person. I honestly think that will make you decision easier."}

I concede those in agreement that they would be better off not being born. I'm only going to argue physical, intellectual, and developmental disability. Here is the really unfortunate thing about prenatal testing in its current format: you still just don't really know. The tests, first of all have a failure rate. Not just a failure to detect, but they also have false positives. Setting false positives entirely aside. Even with a true positive, it does not give an indication of severity of the disability. For example genetic testing gives a yes no answer for downs. However downs is a spectrum disorder and many people with downs have a normal IQ and a normal capacity to learn. That said, it's morally wrong to abort a fetus when you don't know what the outcome really is especially if you are going to base the decision to abort on a fuzzy idea like \"suffering\". Had there been a test for autism, I 100% would have aborted my baby. What I would never have known had I done that is that my kid is 100% awesome with an IQ of 150+. It's she autistic? Yes. It's that all she is? Nope. I literally might have aborted the person who sine day might cure cancer. Likewise there are a lot of blind, deaf and other disabled people who have achieved huge accomplishments in various fields ranging from music to science. You are saying their lives aren't worth while and weren't worth living due to... Suffering? Life is suffering. Every one suffers at some point. In order to argue that having a disabled child is cruel, you would have to argue that having any child, \"healthy\", \"typical\" or otherwise is also cruel because you simply don't know what the outcome will really be. Maybe the kid will get cancer. Maybe they will run in front of a car. Maybe their genetics cause then to be bipolar. Maybe they have autism. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. You don't know. My autistic child is happy and not suffering a bit. She's also a good person who contributes to humanity in a positive way. Meanwhile I know a few kids who were born completely healthy who have suffered horribly due to things like cancer or the death of a parent. Saying that we should abort a disabled fetus because the child might suffer in life is ridiculous because anyone who is born may very well have a shit life full of suffering. If you argue to abort based on the fact someone might suffer, then you need to argue that all babies should be aborted, not just the disabled, because there is a possibility that they might suffer as children."}

Instead, if it enters the public domain, and other people take up the mantle, it can rekindle interest in your creation and you can produce more along those lines to an expanded audience. I strongly agree with \/u\/natha105 that the copyright limit should be 50 years, which would be enough to cover the artist's lifetime. 50 years is still too long as it still means too many works will disappear without being preserved or added to our culture.","output":"If these writers were allowed to employ an additional 145 years worth of public domain material, they could have far more creations on their hands. That is an over-generalization. There are many many artists who would not benefit at all from other public domain material. Someone writing a book would do it based on an interesting premise or idea. How are they benefiting from other copyright books going out of copyright? The example you gave of fan-fiction actually only applies to the few blockbuster works that become cult classics or massively popular. You're again using the same example of the \"big guns\". My argument is centered around protecting the interests and financial viability of the small struggling artists. On top of that, if you can't produce something that earns you an income, perhaps that isn't the job for you? There's no guarantee to profitability written in to copyright, only the guarantee to a chance at it. Hold on! Most artists are not in it for the money. They do it because they are genuinely passionate about what they do, and want to express themselves. Note that almost all the big painters and artists and poets of old, died of utter penury. Their art was mostly not even discovered or acknowledged in their lifetimes. Are you saying they \"should not have bothered\"? Sure, there is not guarantee written into copyright. I'm only talking about letting them make whatever money they make from their art during their lifetimes. How is that unreasonable? if I write a book and publish it, and it makes some money but then fades in popularity to the point that it's no longer profitable, what's the value to you in protecting it for another century and a half? I did not say that at all! I said that the revenues slowed down to a trickle. The trickle is still vitally important. If someone is making a couple of hundred every month from a book due to e-book sales, it is a vital source of income for them. Taking the book out of copyright would wipe out that income stream. If you also read \"The Long Tail\", the main argument of the book is that because there are no \"storage costs\" for e-books and other internet material, it can exist forever. Sales for many many such creative works never dies down to zero - just goes down to a trickle. In a large enough internet marketplace, there are always some people who want to buy these books, no matter how niche or obscure they are. I also said 50 years, not a century and a half, so not sure why you are saying that. Yes, there is indeed value. If I write 20 books in my lifetime, and each earns me 200-300 dollars a month, this is very real livable income for me. Especially when I become old and can no longer continue producing creative works. There's no pension or company sponsored 401k for an independent artist."}

Let me try to pull them apart. Firstly, you are advocating moral anti-realism against moral realism. Moral realism is the claim that moral facts can be true or false based on objective features of the world. Moral anti-realism claims that moral facts are mind dependent. Thus, the truth of moral facts depends on the individual. The second claim you are making is one of consequentialism against some form of moral absolutism. You claim that the rightness or wrongness of an act is totally dependent on its consequences. However, this contradicts your previous point. If moral facts are true or false based on objective features of the world (measurable suffering), then morality doesn't differ from individual to individual. Right? Because of this confusion, you are oversimplifying a complex issue. Because you see the contrast as Christian moral absolutism vs. consequentialist morality (with no room for, say, a secular ethic based on duty rather than consequences), you are making the mistake of asserting an overly consequences-obsessed moral system."}

Two is that people have an abiding love for Mandela. Doubtless some news editors knew him, some reporters were inspired by him, and they know their readers adore him so they feel it is their duty to keep everyone as informed as possible. Second, I think most people who read these stories are trying to come to grips with the fact that he will probably not make it through the day. He was a larger-than-life figure, and there will be billions of people mourning his passing. I've heard him described as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln combined to the South African people, and the national father.

That violates the \"one man one vote\" principle, which is thousands of years old, old and established enough perhaps to label the rule \"natural\". But if you post something to sub A, and it is linked from sub B, and it attracts downvotes from real users, why is that unnatural? That seems pretty organic to me. It is certainly no less \"natural\" than any other kind of vote. Now one could argue, if sub B is really powerful, that small subs need some kind of brigade protection from sub A. You might call that idea protectionism, and I think there is a good conversation that we could have about it, and when it is appropriate. But if we want to talk about protectionism, there is no need to use \"natural\" and \"organic\" and other adjectives we use to advertise fruit. Those words' real function is to demonize the dissent and criticism from other subs as \"unnatural\" and therefore invalid. In my experience the \"natural\" categorization seems selectively applied. Votes from [insert favorite brigade sub here] are \"unnatural\" as a matter of course, but I have not heard nearly as many complaints about the upvote brigade at \/r\/bestof, or when \/r\/XYZSub links a post in less-popular \/r\/XYZDiscussion, etc. This leads me to believe that words like \"unnatural\" and \"brigade\" are less about legitimately categorizing voting behavior according to some kind of objective criteria, and more about inventing a plausibly-objective moral standard that we pull out when our post is downvoted to demonstrates that the critics are a motley crew of rapscallions.","output":"What is \"natural\" about votes?

I will make the addendum that votes from outside subs are not intrinsically bad, but they are almost always bad in practice.

If you did it on purpose obviously you're guilty, but what if you slid on ice and accidentally hit them? Hmmm... \"Law 1: No murder on purpose.\" But what if I want to murder somebody on purpose so I intentionally drive just a little too recklessly? Who determines that? Well, we're going to need judges. Which then leads to the next problem: I kill a man on accident, and I know it's an accident, but I'm not terribly good at speaking and the family says I did it on purpose because I didn't like the guy. So I hire a friend who's good at speaking to help me figure out what to say. He's done this a few times, so he's pretty good about figuring out what to say and when to help me make my case.

But then somebody buys a copy, scans it in, and starts making and selling his own copies with your name crossed out and his written over it. You go to court, but in order to make an official claim there has to be a law. We call this sort of law copyright law. Copyright law (And other systems of laws) get complex not (just) because of greedy lawyers, but because once you say \"You cannot hunt animals that are dying out\" somebody will say \"How do you define 'dying out'?\" and another will say \"How do you define hunting?\" and another will say \"How do you define animal?\" So you write that out. And then eventually you go from \"You cannot hunt animals that are dying out\" to a massive document that requires an expert to suss out the exact meaning. This sort of thing happens over and over again with all sorts of things. It's just human nature to begin pushing on anything that's vague, which means you have to be specific to make sure the law is actually followed. Unfortunately, creating a comprehensive rulebook for life isn't an easy process which means even the most well-meaning legislature will eventually end up with a mess."}

In any case, in economics there is an idea of positive externalities that make free college beneficial to society as a whole. Here are a few bullet points for you to chew over: People, regardless of their wealth, would have equal opportunity to accomplish their goals. Those in poverty would not be limited simply because of their inability to afford college. So in the future, your kids will be able to go to a $60,000 school if they qualified in merit. In the long term, free college would mean that more people would be educated and be able to occupy higher paying jobs. Ultimately, these people would be paying back into the system through their own taxes. The returns on this investment is high since it would only take a few breakthroughs in technology to create many other jobs. Consider how the university system created Gopher, a predecessor to the modern day internet browser. In addition, educated people have greater potential to make more income when they graduate.

Yes, this includes the United States. This is a huge advantage. Most numbers I've seen indicate a 2\/3 drop in the odds of contracting either of these diseases, making it medically similar to a vaccination. Remember, this doesn't just prevent the disease from hitting that person, it also prevents the disease from spreading from that person if they never get it in the first place. 2) Despite claims to the contrary, there's no evidence it harms sensitivity or anything like that. I've actually taken the time to talk to people who got the procedure later in life, and they all agreed that in general your sensitivity spikes WAY up after getting it, for about 6 months (making it too painful to have sex during that time). After that, it returns to normal. Studies on this topic are mixed, with an average of \"no change\". 3) The procedure heals FAR faster on a baby than on an adult. It's 6 months of pain vs maybe a day. This is similar to getting braces when you're young to avoid far more pain when you're older. Waiting until the person is old enough to make a choice themselves means waiting until they have a long painful process to go through during which they can't be sexually active (which obviously is an issue for a young adult but not for a baby). Complications are also a lot more likely on an adult. 4) Parents always give consent for medical procedures of their babies, so I don't see this as a consent issue unless for some reason the parents are not competent to make the decision.

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"The US is one of the few developed countries in this world where the government would be GUARANTEED to fail in instituting martial law if the people at large did not support that decision. I've always found this to be a questionable premise. In every historical case I'm aware of, the government successfully instituting martial law had widespread popular support. We're talking a strong minority and widespread apathy at the least, if not an outright majority. Even your typical tin-pot warlord has strong tribal support from a significant chunk of the population. The guns are irrelevant. If the hypothetical tyrannical government doesn't possess the widespread support, it's a non-starter- they wouldn't even have tight enough control of the rank and file military and national guard to effectively take over anyway. If they have that widespread support, the premise is moot and the game is already lost.","output":"I agree the premise is unlikely, but the point is not the likelihood of occurrence, the point is where the locus of control sits. Starting from a premise of unpopular institution of martial law and then extrapolating the popular reaction and consequences of that popular reaction reveals the group which actually has power, the situation doesn't need to be probable. If a basic tenant of America is that the people are more powerful than the government, something which I think most people accept, then I think one of the critical discussions is whether or not the people can do so when they are at a complete disadvantage to the government in terms of force. If you can draw up a possibility where an overwhelming power is vested in the government at direct opposition to the will of the governed (you can) and the people are unable to resolve that situation, it follows that the people are not actually the group with highest order of influence. If we can capture back that possibility for the people without sacrificing that same order of influence in any other situations (by continuing to protect the rights of the citizenry to bear arms) we should, because it is a system with higher fidelity to that core tenant. Part of the discussion ends up at what the goal of the government is, it is a fairly common view that the goal of government is to provide the optimal life for its people, but America was not designed for that goal - if it were we'd have benevolent dictatorship. American government was designed to limit the risk exposure of the American people to tyranny, that is the one unifying direction in all the foundations of the American political system. Sacrificing any tenant which furthers that central goal in the name of furthering the (absolutely worthy) goal of optimizing the quality of life of its citizenry is fundamentally abrogating the spirit of America. Now, I'll make explicit the fact that I have no problem in doing so - if it is the will of the people that the will of the people not be protected in the interest of promoting the protection of the people (a confusing sentence but I'm running out of brain power at the end of the work day) then I'm perfectly fine with that. What I'm not fine with is holding the discussion which has such profound implications at the level of a specific issue. To use a colorful (if perhaps imperfect) analogy, I see the typical evolution of gun control discussions as a discussion over whether or not to launch a nuclear weapon based on the preference over the aesthetics of the two positions of the launch switch. I might have an opinion on whether or not the switch looks better up or down, but I have a preference _orders of magnitude stronger_ about whether or not a nuclear weapon is launched.

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"I don't mind it when kids say things like \"yolo\" and \"swag\"; I see it as the language evolving. CMV","output":"I think that your general point about language is absolutely correct, and there's not much to disagree on there (unless you are ). Language can, does and should evolve. But just as refusing to let language evolve at all is extreme, so is a completely liberal hands-off approach to it; language is extremely important in all aspects of life as a vehicle for communication, so why shouldn't we be critical about things that affect it? First off, I believe you misunderstood the nature of the opposition to 'yolo' and 'swag' - people aren't reacting to the words, they're reacting to the concepts and the culture that they represent (their reactions are coloured with prejudice, but that's how our minds work). You could argue that carpe diem is a time-honoured concept, but people have convinced themselves that the yoloers are young vandals who are just looking for an excuse to be stupid. Again, who can pass up the chance to feel superior to those imbeciles with their superficial 'swag'? The point about text-speak influencing spoken language is a separate one, and more nuanced. On the one hand, language needs to move with the times. On the other hand, to put it bluntly, text-speak is lazy, and is clearly not an acceptable substitute for written prose in modern society in most professional contexts, and many social and recreational ones in modern society (would you like me to elaborate on this point?). It's harder to argue that it is bad for spoken language. Indeed, written French and spoken, everyday French are remarkably different (imho because of the severe restrictions placed on written language enforced by the Acad\u00e9mie I linked to above). As long as we remain vigilant about our written language, we can happily let our spoken language lapse, right? Well, it's difficult. I hate to be prescriptivist, but language is a lot more central to our intelligence than we might first believe. They say that innuits have 100 different words for snow. This anecdote is probably not true, but imagine for a second that you did know 100 different words for snow, each slightly different. An English speaker would look at snow, and just see 'snow'. If he paid attention to it, he would notice hundreds of characteristics and properties - maybe it's shiny, crunchy, sparkly, fresh, slushy, wet, dry, compact, powdery... but without further prompting he probably wouldn't. You, however, would automatically process all of these characteristics in order to decide which word for snow best fits, and the nature of the snow will be a lot more precise and readily accessible in your memory. I am just trying to illustrate a feature of language that is introspectively obvious: precise vocabulary is the cornerstone of intuitive understanding. The more rigorous, precise and varied your language, the more intelligent you are, in a very real way. If, indeed, text-speak is a concession towards laziness as I stated above, it should be avoided by people who value their intelligence, as lazy language promotes lazy thought. Indeed, I believe that we do this naturally - text-speak feels uninspired and unoriginal most of the time. Please do not twist this argument by concluding that people who make extensive use of text-speak are dumb; this absolutely does not follow from the above. Also, this does not prevent us from extracting the more creative aspects of text-speak and making use of them - in order to bring my long ramble full circle, we absolutely should let our language evolve - subject to critical scrutiny."}

Both have to do with a woman's reproductive system. But what I'm going to go ahead and call the umbrella issues are different. Abortion is more or less the union of two issues: Bodily autonomy, and church vs state (again, more or less). Under topics relating to bodily autonomy you might find issues such as... whether you can sell your liver after you die, or whether you can consume drugs in your own home. Under church vs state, you can find issues such as... whether to include \"under god\" in the pledge of allegiance. Here, these issues boil down to a woman's control over her own body, and what does it mean to be a human. Point being, these \"umbrella issues\" aren't the whole story, but arguments for or against it usually fall under them. On the other hand, contraception availability is certainly not an issue about bodily autonomy or church vs state. It is an issue about where to spend taxpayer dollars, the role of the government, and what constitutes adverse selection. I can be pro or against contraception, but for reasons having nothing to do with whether I am against abortion. If I believe that requiring abortions as backup is due to insufficient contraception, fine.

For patients willing to skip this type of care my idea is for a bonus according the following formula: immediate bonus = 50% of (actuarial underwriting of standard medical care \u2013 hospice care). The patient maintains control over the optionality, but an immediate benefit opens up to them (one last grand vacation, a lasting legacy for the next generation, etc).

I work on the reinsurance side of things and my team usually sends up about a dozen proposals like this a year for discussion purposes, none of them are remotely possible under the current regulatory environment but I always live in hope that something might change. Insurers are not permitted to incentivize specific interventions even at the physician level. Even healthy living incentives can only be achieved via premium discounts and then only on the group market, EG - insurers can discount a premium if an employer bans smoking around their building but can't base that on the efficacy of the program nor provide some form of refund based on efficacy. The unrealistic ideal would be a dynamic co-pay based on your estimated QALE with intervention adjusted for lifestyle factors; if you are healthy and young then you would pay almost nothing for a heart transplant if yours fails, if you are a retired morbidly obese smoker then you will be paying almost all cost out of pocket when your heart fails. An enormous part of the current cost problems we face are with end of life care and the absence of any of the consumption restrictions that exist in every other country in the world, physicians treat far more aggressively (IMHO violating their oath, frequently end of life treatment reduces QALE) and we keep throwing interventions at people when hospice or home palliative care would be objectively a better choice. Beyond the cost problems end of life care creates (3-4% of health consumers consuming nearly half of total healthcare consumption per year) for elderly patients providing such generous benefits via Medicare , this really needs to be addressed as we migrate to a universal system as its neither economically nor morally justified to subsidize the wealthy at the expense of the poor in this manner."}

Or what if you say, \"hey, everyone can have pizza, but I need time to bake more for everyone. Form a line and each person gets a slice when it's their turn.\" The latter seems reasonable to me, not selfish. Immigration is the similar. Any given country can only accept a sudden influx of additional people wanting a piece of their economic \"pie\" before the size of each slice becomes so small it's no longer valuable. As years pass a country's economy will grow and its capacity for more immigrants may increase, but this takes time - just like baking more pizza in the above.

Not that there's anything wrong with that argument, I just disagree. In your view, the means (killing apes, who cannot consent) are unfortunate, but justify the ends (medical knowledge). And the course of action is quite obviously optional. You just don't like the other option. I'm not sure why you'd argue otherwise. Your example of an Alzheimer's drug doesn't at all resemble what actual drug tests look like, so I'll skip it. Hell, we share 70 something percent of our DNA with bananas, why don't we give them personhood to? I think you're being absurd because my argument is making you uncomfortable. It's patently obvious that apes are like us, the question is how much like us they need to be before you're willing to offer them the protections of personhood. And your qualifications--thanks for giving them--are easy to reply to. In (a), you're saying the opposite of what I think you mean. Lacking the ability to consent is precisely why you shouldn't experiment on something--like the comatose, mentally handicapped, or to use your very example, the person in your Alzheimer's study who is \"not in their right mind.\" If it were proven that apes could give informed consent, that would actually be a mark in your favor! As for (b), most primatologists agree that great apes can achieve the intelligence (and presumably something like the conscious experience) of a 2-6 year old human, the age depending on who you ask. We can say two years old if you like. Still, that's more than many mentally-handicapped\/comatose humans! So I think (b) has been shown. And, even though \"level of unhappiness\" can't actually be measured, I don't think you really believe (c), which suggests that if we discovered an alien species as conscious and intelligent as us, it would be OK to experiment on them with impugnity so long as it hurt us less than it hurt them. That's a pretty ethically dubious stance. If you really do believe (c), I can see we're going to disagree on quite a lot, and might as well quit here.","output":"And the course of action is quite obviously optional. As is breathing, technically. Scientific research is going to happen, and is optional only in the silliest and most technical sense of the word \"optional\". Your example of an Alzheimer's drug doesn't at all resemble what actual drug tests look like, so I'll skip it. Yes, it does. Eighty-two percent of primate procedures in the UK in 2006 were in applied studies, which the Home Office defines as research conducted for the purpose of developing or testing commercial products.[38] Toxicology testing is the largest use, which includes legislatively required testing of drugs. The drug tenofovir has had its efficacy and toxicology evaluated in macaques, and found longterm-highdose treatments had adverse effects not found using short term-high dose treatment followed by long term-low dose treatment. This finding in macaques was translated into human dosing regimens. That is the number one use of non-human primates in research, to test and make sure that the drugs are not going to kill people. I think you're being absurd because my argument is making you uncomfortable. It doesn't make me uncomfortable. I'm being absurd because your argument is absurd. You're proposing that there's some quality to great apes, which you cannot identify, that qualifies them for personhood. We share lots of qualities with lots of animals (and plants). What is so special about great apes, other than they look and act like us, that makes them eligible for personhood? My arguments are absurd because I don't have anything to argue against other than \"Apes should be people because I say so\". Lacking the ability to consent is precisely why you shouldn't experiment on something So.... we shouldn't experiment on rats or bugs or parrots either? They can't consent, and they certainly feel pain. There's a reason why that isn't the sole criteria. and presumably something like the conscious experience So is that the dividing factor here? That the animal experiences a consciousness similar to ours? One of the prime examples of our self-awareness is an awareness of our own mortality. I haven't seen anything where a non-human primate seemed to be conscious of the fact that they will die. Some of these primates don't even seem to understand the concept of death, ignoring rotting corpses near them. Yes, they likely have a consciousness more similar to ours than other animals, but that's a relative measure; there are a large number of animals who could be said to have a consciousness \"similar to ours\" depending on how close you require that to be. Other animals experience things like sadness, that is not unique to primates. which suggests that if we discovered an alien species as conscious and intelligent as us, it would be OK to experiment on them with impugnity so long as it hurt us less than it hurt them. That's a pretty ethically dubious stance. Not really. If we found a race of aliens who were taxonomically similar to us who, for instance, did not feel pain then yes, it would be far more ethical to conduct a painful experiment on them than it would us. I'm not proposing that we willy-nilly conduct random experimentation on them, but if we were to arrive at a point where it was necessary to conduct an experiment for the furthering of essential research, then yes, I find it more ethical to experiment on them."}

{"instruction":"Generate a counterargument to:","input":"CMV: Both Republican and Democratic political parties are corrupt. They are two sides of the same coin.","output":"It's important to understand what exactly we mean by corruption. I think that the broad generalization of \"the system is corrupt\" isn't necessarily a helpful one because it doesn't address what is actually going on clearly enough. \"Political corruption\" in the United States, particularly at higher levels, doesn't generally mean that politicians are lining their own pockets or personally profiting off the positions they take. Corruption mostly constitutes an allegedly improper relationship between the political positions a politician takes and the donations which are made to their political campaigns. It's important to keep this in mind, because the #1 goal of politicians is to get elected, and get re-elected. Campaign contributions are a mechanism for making that more likely, because a well-funded candidate can run ads to get their positions out, tell their story, and attack their opponents. But at the end of the day, that's all the money is doing. The money isn't buying your vote or anybody else's. The votes cast by constituents are the things that actually elect politicians and keep them there. As a result, if you gave most politicians a choice between taking a position that will lose $10 million in campaign contributions versus taking a position that will lose 10% of their vote, they will sacrifice the money every single time. I live in DC and know tons of people who work or have worked on the Hill, and they uniformly tell me nothing gets their boss's attention more strongly than a sense that large numbers of their constituents are upset about something. As a voter, you have a voice. And if you can convince a politician that some position you care about will impact their odds of getting elected, you will gain their ear much more strongly than if you bundled $50,000 in donations to them. If one of the parties seems to advocate principles you generally agree with, give them the votes they need to make those principles a reality, and do your best to punish them electorally when they depart from them. I mean, much as I despise the Tea Party, they are living proof that this works. I guarantee to you that the Republican Party's major donors did not want a government shutdown in 2013.

Marx' view of sociopolitical power structures is clearly evolutionary; if we're going to apply simple evolutionary law to political structures, (eg survival of the fittest), then why does communism rely on no competition, whatsoever? This seems suspect, to say the least. The current world system is capitalism. It has been for the last century. Before that, the world system was feudalism and traditional economies. Capitalism didn't rise in just one country and stayed in one country for a century, capitalism swept the most powerful areas of the world, specifically Europe. Right now, feudalism on a large scale in today's world would not be possible. Same with traditional economies So, capitalism is a world system, that is run by the international bourgeoisie, and produces the international proletariat. How can an international system be overthrown in only one country? How can countries be abolished, if there are still countries? How can a classless communal society exist, if there are classes and property? The bourgeoisie is an international class - how can you abolish it in one place? That's like curing yourself of blood poisoning, but only in one toe. The 'former' proletarians are still proletarians. You haven't abolished capitalism entirely. is a goal of socialism. Socialism and communism cannot exist in one or two countries while a directly opposing system surrounds them, just like feudalism and traditional economies cannot do the same. Capitalism will likely not be able to survive in one country if the entire world was socialist. Two things. One, your second sentence is crucial; people recognize not only the authority of their government to do certain things, but also the power of the same to do things, regardless of whether they agree with the things being done. This is the chokepoint through which every. single. Communist. state. has failed to pass; inevitably, the leaders of the People's revolution realize they've been handed absolute power, even if it's only supposed to be temporary; you know what they say about absolute power. That's why worker councils, i.e., Soviet councils existed, to be a checks and balances of the workers vs the leaders. It's also not just one person managing the state, various political positions exist, akin to something like the U.S. legislative and executive system. If they realize they have been handed absolute power, they should know that the power ONLY exists because the people being governed accept it, even if they disagree, like you said. You have those who will enforce your power, like the military or the police. But those people only enforce your power because they too, recognized it and accepted it. Look at it this way, if all of a sudden everyone in the United States refused to recognize Obama and his power, including the military, and they choose not to listen to him, then Obama has no power and cannot exert force or wishes, and nothing he does will be enforced. First, if you increase the landmass of the European countries to make a country the size of the USSR, you start getting towards that massive number of casualties; it's unfair to say no single European country had losses on the Russian scale without acknowledging that Russia is so much larger. Second, communism didn't exist for all that long. If we're strictly talking about the USSR, it won the civil war in 1922 and dissolved in 1991, a run of only 69 years; not even an average human lifespan. In contrast, America is a \"young\" country...and 240 years old next year, having been democratic capitalist republic for the entirety of that existence. The USSR had plenty of satellite republics and international support, not to mention China; to claim that 'the whole world' was against it whitewashes the balance of power, especially during the Cold War. Should it not be death's per capita, rather that landmass, that allows comparisons of this type? And where did you learn that, I was unaware of that information. Look at stress again. The U.S. never faced massive casualties except in the Civil War, and the British didn't torch everything they owned, except the capital of course. The U.S. even faced decades of isolationism, had an open landmass and few neighboring countries that allowed Manifest Destiny to occur. It took them more than a hundred years anyway to take the torch from Great Britain and become the world superpower. The US had ideal conditions for it's growth, almost perfect. While you are right that the USSR lasted an incredibly short time, it also became a superpower in a incredibly short time. The level of industrialization that the US achieved in 200 years was achieved by the USSR in 20-30. Again, you're looking for a utopian environment, and it just doesn't exist; to seek a government where corruption isn't a problem on some level, sooner or later, is to ignore basic human nature. But in a country where the need for personal material and financial wealth is virtually eliminated, exactly WHAT would corrupt a government? What would drive them to abuse the system?","output":"The current world system is capitalism. It has been for the last century. Before that, the world system was feudalism and traditional economies. Capitalism didn't rise in just one country and stayed in one country for a century, capitalism swept the most powerful areas of the world, specifically Europe. Capitalism, however, allows for other forms of government, including monarchy, theocracy, and yes, \"C\"ommunism, to coexist with it. \"c\"ommunism, as you define it, cannot tolerate the existence of any of these, much less capitalism. I admit to being somewhat mystified that you argue that capitalism has held sway for the last century even though the USSR, once again, was a major world power and clearly not capitalist at all, especially in the early years. If you include China in the mix, the USSR and China had nearly 890 million people out of a total population of approximately 3 billion in 1960; that's roughly a third of the world's population in a clearly non capitalistic state within the last 60 years, not century, so claiming capitalism has had global hegemony in the last century is clearly false. World communism is a goal of socialism. Socialism and communism cannot exist in one or two countries while a directly opposing system surrounds them... China and Russia have been traditional centers of power, not satellites. They dictate the conditions around them, not vice versa; Ukraine being a perfect current event example. Capitalism will likely not be able to survive in one country if the entire world was socialist. Absent violent overthrow, I don't agree; capitalism has shown to be one of the best methods of improving economic conditions of any practicable sociopolitical platform. It does not depend on exterior forces to survive and thrive. That's why worker councils, i.e., Soviet councils existed, to be a checks and balances of the workers vs the leaders. It's also not just one person managing the state, various political positions exist, akin to something like the U.S. legislative and executive system. They were created, but to say they existed is to elide the fact that they vanished almost as soon as they appeared in the Soviet consciousness; to quoth Lenin (who you say was doing just fine until Stalin barged in) \"\"history of all countries bears out the fact that through their own powers alone, the working class can develop only a trade-union consciousness.\" What is to be Done, 1902. From wikipedia, for the sake of speed: \"That is, history had demonstrated that the working class could engage in local, spontaneous rebellions to improve its position within the capitalist system but that it lacked the understanding of its interests necessary to overthrow that system.\" The idea that Soviet leadership truly trusted the proletariat has always been somewhat suspect. If they realize they have been handed absolute power, they should know that the power ONLY exists because the people being governed accept it, even if they disagree, like you said. You have those who will enforce your power, like the military or the police. But those people only enforce your power because they too, recognized it and accepted it. You're assuming, first, that military and police are all that good at thinking; second, you're making the mistake that even if they think - as opposed to following orders - that they agree with you. Finally, remember that in modern times, it's not necessary to have a majority agree; military hardware is designed with the term \"force multiplier\" in mind. If you're so right about how it's possible for consent of the governed to actually function, how come every communist state has reverted to authoritarianism? Should it not be death's per capita, rather that landmass, that allows comparisons of this type? And where did you learn that, I was unaware of that information. Fine, going by the Third Reich's numbers in WWII, they lost 10% of their total population; in comparison, Russia suffered 13.5%. Large real number difference, but not statistically significant in terms of culture shock; going back to WWI, the German Empire lost around 3.5% of its' population versus Russia's 2%. Source: and If you want to compare on that basis, Russia has no argument for any especial consideration of hardship. The level of industrialization that the US achieved in 200 years was achieved by the USSR in 20-30. The Second Industrial Revolution didn't even start until 1860; this was when steel began to be mass produced. To say that it took the US that much longer is to ignore that the technical processes literally didn't exist until much closer to the time the USSR was interested in developing. But in a country where the need for personal material and financial wealth is virtually eliminated, exactly WHAT would corrupt a government? What would drive them to abuse the system? Power? Needs and wants aren't the same thing.

There's nothing about a government that intrinsically can't be done (sometimes quite a lot cheaper) by a private entity. If the damages are properly accounted for (by whichever if the many proposed justice systems), then the transgressors would indeed pay the fees. The first few times this happened, it might be a little messy, but once a precedent is set, few farmers will be willing to risk the cost, as it will be known that this discharge is not permitted. The same as if a government set a regulation, but with the benefit that actual harm had been proven, and politics aren't involved. The notion that governments have done kind of magic that makes them impossible to replace is an idea than ancaps reject. Again, though, most libertarians are in favor of having a government for exactly these purposes."}

I think the Wyoming Rule is just a band-aid solution to legislature size. It is dependent on the relative size of states, and not on some fixed ratio. Under it, we could have and have had a unusably sized House. The worldwide trend in legislature size is for the more populous chamber (in our case, the House) to have as many members as the cubed root of the population. For the U.S., that would be a House size of about 685. I think this is a better metric and still gives us a workable size."}

Being \"free\" is not having 1\/100,000,000th (for example) of a say in how a country is run. Being free to live your life the way you want and pursue happiness is not predicated on being able to choose who runs the country every X years (aside from the fact that in most representative democracies, your representative is far more dependent on where you live than your personal opinion). I would much rather live in a country governed by reason and logic by people who know what they're doing rather than vote for people who have to make populist decisions and spend half their term trying to get re-elected. You could be safe and free or unsafe and oppressed in both of those systems. Safety and freedom are not proportional to level of democracy. No, real life experience suggests that this is true in some instances, some of which are temporary. Whether it's temporary is highly arguable. If democratic government A makes bad decisions of a large enough scope, the consequences will stick around when government B takes over. Things like environmental, energy or foreign policy don't reset after an election. If government A enacted disastrous policies on climate change or started a war, the effects of these decisions will be permanent or at best very difficult to reverse. Even worse, if government C alters the education system in a wrong way due to populist demand, the effects will be felt for as long as the children affected by that system are alive. A good example of this is the to make the most detailed version of the census voluntary. This was despite the objection of , and . Now Canada has no reliable census data past 2006. will haunt Canada for decades. The was made was because people didn't like filling out the long form census because it was too long. Just because a decision is popular doesn't mean it's the right one to make. It's better to win someone over with sound arguments and reason than to force them to comply with your wishes. You might be able to catch more flies with honey than vinegar, but this doesn't extend to humans. If a group of humans are used to vinegar (or are told that they should want vinegar by vinegar salesmen), there is no amount of sound arguments about how honey is better that will sway them. They will invent rationale as to why honey is actually bad for them or why vinegar cures cancer. This is talking about a group people as a collective. A person might be reasonable, but people are dumb.

But power will corrupt the monarch, and probably sooner rather than later. Whether it's temporary is highly arguable. I disagree. Literally any example of things improving in a democracy along rational guidelines means that it is, at least in some instances, temporary. If a group of humans are used to vinegar (or are told that they should want vinegar by vinegar salesmen), there is no amount of sound arguments about how honey is better that will sway them.

Instead, part of \"willpower\" is avoiding temptation in the first place. Building habits to keep yourself out of situations where you could be tempted is what actually works, so any meaningful conceptualization of the trait that causes someone to deal with temptation needs to include that. This DOESN'T change the issue that not everyone is on equal ground to start with: some temptations are stronger for some people.

If they are doing it for a particular thing, then they have no reason to develop that career once they have the thing they are after. The only instance where people build a career for the sheer sake of building a career is ironically when it's not about the money at all - they do it because it is something they believe in and enjoy, and it is genuinely an experience that makes them grow as a person. But those individuals are far and few in between - The majority of people who work at careers do it so they aren't 'losers' (i.e. do it to attain social value through the money they earn).

So I thought it was worth mentioning, if there's a definite catalyst for the higher crime rates. However as long as the other side of the coin is not preferable to the side we are focusing on, the point still remains: some things, not all, are better off banned. And that's where (and I say this completely respectfully) your confirmation bias comes in. The US has far too many guns for something like a buyback to really be effective. It IS effective when it can be centered - NYC has had some success. But nationwide? It could never realistically happen, because as soon as the government threatens to do ANYTHING with guns, sales spike, even legal ones. Dangerous how? Specially in the US these people are running away form worse options. In other countries I agree people are being trafficked, conned and abused, but I guess you didn't mean those cases. Dangerous to the worker and to the people they're doing the work for. Installing roofs without fall protection, questionable placement of ladders, and more seriously, harsh chemicals for weed control, structural issues in buildings they construct, things like that. And on the side of the person hiring them, it's a huge risk that a) you're actually going to receive the service you pay for, and b) if they get injured, they'll still come after you and sue you, and if they don't, the government will. I am not sure I understand. How would legalizing child prostitution reduce the danger? Like I said, it requires you to put the morality of it aside for a second. The same way in which if adult prostitution was legal, it wouldn't be an industry that can only exists in dark alleys, seedy motels, and \"under the radar\" so to speak. The parties involved would have much less incentive to hide the activity, and therefore much less incentive to intimidate and terrorize the workers into keeping quiet. I mean, there's a whole other issue that children can't consent, and they're the only ones that dictate what goes on with their body (at least after they're born) and of course, age of consent and all. But again, I highlighted some of the problems that are inevitable in any industry that's illegal. In order to refute an argument in favour of banning adult prostitution, some are willing to support legalizing child prostitution? I think it's insane. I'm not trying to argue that at all, I'm just trying to draw an analogy. Prostitution, at least in most of the US, is still illegal. Therefore, the people who engage in it and facilitate it are basically already committed to a life of crime. Possession of marijuana, again, in most states, is illegal. Therefore the vast majority of the marijuana industry in the US is still run by career criminals and gangs. During the prohibition era, the market for alcohol was a huge enabler for the mob to be established in the US. If there's a market, there will be a business. The legality only affects HOW the people doing business go about it. The more illegal something is, the further people will go to protect their interests in it.","output":"The US has far too many guns for something like a buyback to really be effective This is not the point though. We are only analyzing the generic statement \"banning something is worse than the object or service being banned\", so if we find that countries with gun bans have positive results, like a decreased murder rate, then the statement is at least weak, probably wrong. The fact you find a place where a gun ban is highly complex and unlikely doesn't matter. We are not talking about the statement \"any ban is better\", at least that is not the statement I am offering in return. it requires you to put the morality of it aside for a second But as you can't keep it away indefinitely, it's a false exercise. It's like saying \"if child prostitution weren't immoral, we wouldn't need ban it\"...you see the problem with that statement, right? I highlighted some of the problems that are inevitable in any industry that's illegal Which is only relevant to this discussion if it leads to the conclusion that legalizing it is better than banning it. I don't think you have established that. The more illegal something is, the further people will go to protect their interests in it. You have said this before and I think it fails as a generic statement. You used examples where the bans worsen the problem than legalizing it: prostitution, drugs, alcohol, porn, etc. We have the precedent than in some societies these have been successfully legalized with more upsides than cons. I agree these are better off legalized. However you seem to forget the point being debated : \"Making a product or service illegal only creates a black market which is generally more harmful than what is being made illegal\". This is a generic statement not specific to the examples you (and OP) chose. For this to be true, ANY ban has to be worse than the \"unban\" and I think I showed examples of this not being the case. Let's rephrase your statement in a non-generic way and see if it holds: \"The more illegal rape and murder is, the further people will go to protect their interests in it\". Does it make sense like that?"}

The fact that, as you mentioned, it would be impossible to tax every individual according to their responsibility does not negate the fact that there are variables to be tweaked in order to promote fairness and justice.

God's original covenant with man (old) after the fall was essentially with Abraham. Abraham had demonstrated immense faith and devotion to God, and God saw fit to reward this by making his descendents into a great nation. These were the ancient israelites, born into covenant with God. Essentially, obey the lawband God would make them prosperous. This was the mosaic law. Of course, the israelites fail time and time again and are conquered and re-conquered by their enemies. Because of this, the coming of a new covenant was foretold - one that, as we now know, was inclusive of all people regardless of blood. This covenant was sealed by the blood of Jesus (after which the apostles began to spread the faith) which, though it didn't destroy or eliminate the law, essentially freed people from it. Now, salvation is based not on following the law, but acceptance of the sacrifice and Jesus' rulership. Moral guidelines Christians still follow involve 1. those Jesus or the apostles directly spoke of (called moral laws) or 2. Avoiding all forms of idolatry. The sacrifice of Jesus obviated the need for sacrifice and cultural\/ceremonial law as practiced by the ancient israelites. I hope that's clear?

If you can find 10 people who would willingly risk their lives to go \"marauding\" with no guaranteed pay-off, you'd still have to at least come up with the resources to get your venture off the ground. At best, perhaps you could loot one or two homes before people got wise to what was up-- and if history and the vast majority of social sciences are any indicator, most people prefer to live in communities without the threat of being pillaged. Why would they all do nothing when they know they all have something at stake they could lose? It simply doesn't add up. Expecting that people would throw off the state only to get antsy when lesser armed thugs come around is just plain unrealistic.

Additionally, a large organization does not make for a government-- governments, as organizations, have certain conditions and features that make it unique as opposed to other forms of social organization. Moreover, it is an exercise in cognitive dissonance to suggest that by preventing you from marauding our homes we are in some manner using coercion: the entire premise of the state is institutionalized marauding under the pretense of creating order. Anarchism, as a philosophy and practical program, rejects this nonsensical reasoning-- it claims that the victims of oppression who form a response are in fact oppressors for not simply standing by and letting their personal autonomy be trampled upon.

Anything you can do, others can do as well-- you've managed to mitigate the cost of violence, it seems reasonable others would figure out a way to mitigate the cost of defense. In any case, this seems not to be rooted in any actual argument, just a really vague hypothetical of \"well, what if I came up with the problem that couldn't be solved!\" No matter what scenario you carve out, it ignores the basic fact that in an anarchist society everyone will have a stake in keeping their community ordered, and because information will not be stop-gapped by hierarchy, will flow more readily. With more information will come more innovation as communities figure out how to eliminate marauders like you (assuming, of course, you can actually come through with your magical cost saving device that the state has, for some reason, simply been uncreative enough to explore). And as for your comments about hierarchy, I get that, too. It makes sense that someone used to living a certain way would continue, and would not run to past failures. But, first, it would be awfully hard to erase the memory of a past with a state; or rather, it would be really tempting for some, I think, to fill some non-state area with a state of their design. If you can come up with a realistic scenario that doesn't involve vague hypothetical problems where you can magically mitigate cost (I've done my best to draw real world examples for my points; at best, you've given us a Mad Max scenario that takes the worst assumptions about people for granted), I'll give it a listen, but as far as I can tell this is a non-point.

It is likely the state came out of temple accounting systems and resource organization; given the fact that the state seems to arise at a time when debt as a concept entered the human imagination, it is also likely that this played a role in its formation.

For example, you have to count not just the Madonnas, but also the small bands playing a couple gigs a week for almost (or actually) nothing hoping to get noticed. Not just the A-Rods, not just the people making the major league minimum (400k), but also the people making the minor league average (10k) of whom there are far more. I make three times more doing science than a lot of minor leaguers make playing baseball, and my chances of that going up to four or maybe five times (post-doctoral fellowship) are much higher than the chances of the average minor leaguer being promoted to the majors.

Read a book or something. Also how was the 1979 revolution religiously fundamentalist? It challenged so many of the religiously orthodox views of the time in Iran about how religious leaders should not be in charge of the government (this was so unheard of at the time that Khomeini had invented a new religious doctrine called velayat-e-faqih, which means the guardianship of the jurist, to explain how religious people can usurp government control and still be in the right on religious matters). You don't understand Islam, much less the nuances of Shia Islam, that much is obvious. But I am a Shia Muslim, so let me give you some insight. Shia Muslims used to follow the laws and rules of Imams, of whom there were 12. The 12th one is said to have disappeared and is prophesied to reappear again much later in time. But while he is gone, the people cannot be guided by any one ruler, since that one ruler would be taking the place of the Imam (a place he has no right to take). Thus, religiously fundamentalist Shia Muslims have many different religious leaders but none is held over any other like an Imam might be. Khomeini holding himself over all the other Shia religious leaders was the opposite of fundamentalist. It pissed a lot of fundamentalists off because it didn't conform to the fundamental understanding of Shia theology. He wasn't even the most educated or most respected of the Shia religious authorities in Iran. He was pretty young and largely seen as a nobody when it came to religious matters, most of his speeches before the Revolution were expressly political. People barely perceived him as a religiously minded leader.

Now, if you want to look at this statistically, I would GUESS that MOST sex, which occurs under the influence of voluntarily consumed drugs\/alcohol is consensual. I'd even be willing to pull a number out of my ass and say AT LEAST 98%+ it is consensual. However, as I said before, some will be rapes. (Only if they are not rapes - then they are not.

Yes, there's 300 million guns out there, but if we were to ban all gun sales tomorrow people and put some restrictions on selling second-hand guns, the marginal gun-buyer would find getting a gun much harder. IIRC the Navy Yard shooter bought his gun a couple of days prior to the shooting. If he were unable to buy it at the local Wal-Mart or Starbucks or wherever he bought it, he would have to get it illegally. Perhaps he would have succeeded, perhaps not. But we can reasonably suspect that a non-trivial number of potential marginal buyers will simply fail to buy a gun if the ban is enacted. Or it could have taken it him a few weeks to get one, which matters--people who need a gun right now are exactly the kind of people you don't want to sell a gun to. We should also expect gun-buyers to be younger than an average gun-owner. Young people usually take part in shootings. Besides, by limiting the proportion of young people who grow up owning and using guns will start a cycle of decreasing gun-ownership and decreasing ability to use a gun (it's not a trivial thing; I'm from Europe, where no one knows how to use a gun). Think about some illegal drugs. There are ways to get those, but unless you are already \"in\" and know the right people or are sophisticated enough to use services like Silk Road, buying them is by no means easy. There are many heroin users. But suppose that you (not a heroin user, I suppose) would like to get some tomorrow. Would you have a clue where to being looking for one? Most likely not, and that's the point. Banning guns is a huge low-hanging fruit. At the same time I do not think there's anything we could reasonably do about the existing gun stock.

Essentially, I (an anarcho-capitalist) believe that there is nothing that government can provide for us which we can't provide better for ourselves through the market. A few reasons for this are 1) the failures of democracy I described, 2) the fact that competition and the market always produces better results than central planning and bureaucracy, and 3) I believe that government, as a geographical monopoly over the initiation of force, is an inherently immoral thing. Anarcho-capitalism is a philosophy based on non-initiation of force (you can use force to defend yourself, but not for offensive purposes), free markets, and private property. As for how it would work, there is not necessarily one answer for that question. That is kind of the point of anarcho-capitalism, it is the framework for finding solutions that don't involve a gun to your head. If you can think of a way to solve X problem that is better than what anyone else can think of, your idea will succeed on the market. That being said, I don't think it is necessarily fair for someone to point out a problem without supplying ANY better solutions, so I'll provide the common anarcho-capitalist solution for law in a free society. Something we need in society in a system of law for resolving disputes between individuals. I don't think we need government for this. Instead of government holding a monopoly in this market, law could be better provided through a system of private \"rights enforcement agencies\" and arbitration agencies. Basically, I pay for a firm to protect my rights, and you do the same. If we get into a dispute, our agencies agree to abide by the ruling of an arbitration agency. It is predicted that you end up having a system where every individual has a rights enforcement agency, and every pair of rights enforcement agencies has an arbitration agency. There are countless objections to this, but I'm not going to cover them right now. Take a look at summary by David Friedman, it is entertaining and informative. It should cover a few questions as well as describe this system better than I did. Hope that is a decent summary of anarcho-capitalism.

CMV","output":"I see misconceptions about Affirmative Action on here all the time, so let me clarify a few: It is no secret that schools, for example, have a sort of quota for each gender and race that they admit Completely and entirely false. Schools are legally forbidden from having actual quotas. They can consider the diversity of the applicant, based on race, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, nationality, life experience, all sorts of things. They can take them into account, but they are legally forbidden from having racial quotas. There are always check-boxes on applications (schooling, job, etc.) for gender, race, etc. Affirmative action for private employment is entirely different than schools. The government can have it's own policy on how to consider diversity, but that's not how it's dealt with in private employment. Almost all affirmative action policies in the private market are instilled by the leadership of that private company on their own. Why? Because businesses see better leadership, better profits, and wider markets when they have a diverse group of employees that come from different backgrounds, have different values, and have different opinions. Businesses like diversity because it makes businesses stronger, and it's why businesses consider diversity in employment. Society, as a whole, supports equality for everyone. I think that it is a huge contradiction then to still judge people, or give special benefits to people, of certain races or genders. Studies have shown that if you put a racially ethnic name on a resume application, it's significantly less likely to get called for an interview than a more main-stream culture name (like John or Ben). It's the same resume, different names, different racial perceptions, different outcomes. The reality is that society doesn't have equality of opportunity. It's very well documented that people have an \"in-group and out-group\" social process. We tend to like people that are our \"in-group\" (like us) over people in the \"out-group\" (not like us). So, if you consider that most businesses and organizations are led by middle-aged white men, then you can also see why most middle-managers are also middle-aged white men. It's also why middle-aged white men are more likely to respond to resumes that have white men names than other names. It's not their conscious fault, they're not making a decision to discriminate, it's an internal process where we just automatically like people of our in-group more than our out-group. So affirmative action in schools has two goals: 1) the diversity of the students (which is an important end, in order to help educate the student body about different aspects of society, it's important to have different kinds of people), and 2) helping to support marginalized groups (such as the fact that minorities are much more likely to be in poverty, a history of legal suppression has caused generational poverty issues, the resume issue I talked about earlier). It's narrowly tailored to allow schools to consider race, but they're forbidden from having quotas of any kind."}
